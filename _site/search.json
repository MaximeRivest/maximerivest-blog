    "text": "Making an automatic System Prompt tool\nIn this tutorial, I’ll show you how I’ve modified and customized DSPy to make it handle system prompt optimization. Usually DSPy is doing program optimization. DSPy is very much batteries included, giving you tons of tools for everything. It’s general, and it gives you a framework for how to do things, which is powerful and useful. But that framework is about AI programming, not about system prompt optimization. That is why we will need to do some customization to DSPy. Don’t worry, DSPy was built in a way that lets us do it without too much work.\nThe nice thing about having to customize DSPy is that by the end you’ll walk away with two things. First, a way to automatically optimize system prompts. Second, you’ll have opened the hood: you’ll understand better how DSPy works and this will help you use DSPy more proficiently when you actually want to do AI programs.\nSo by the end of this tutorial we will have built this simple yet powerful automatic system prompt optimization utility and understood why we had to do what we did.\n\noptimzed_system_prompt = optimize(\n    training_inputs = [\"User prompt example 1\", \"...\", \"User prompt exampl n\"],\n    training_outputs = [\"Desirable Assistant's example 1\", \"...\", \"Desirable Assistant's example 1\"],\n    llm_judge = \"Return a 1 if it's good and a 0 if it's bad.\"\n)\n\nOur optimize function will also be able to optionally take a starting system prompt, a max few-shots, and teacher and student model identifiers. Here is a mock-up of that:\n\noptimzed_system_prompt = optimize(\n    training_inputs = [\"User prompt example 1\", \"...\", \"User prompt exampl n\"],\n    training_outputs = [\"Desirable Assistant's example 1\", \"...\", \"Desirable Assistant's example 1\"],\n    llm_judge = \"Return a 1 if it's good and a 0 if it's bad.\",\n    system_prompt = \"You are a model that perform well...\",\n    max_few_shots = 2,\n    teacher_model = \"a-smart-model\",\n    student_model = \"a-cheap-model\"\n)\n\nNow that we have our vision, let’s get going!"

    "section": "The task",
    "text": "The task\nAll throughout this tutorial our task will be to make an English to Quebec-French translator.\nThe first DSPy optimizer that we want to use is dspy.MIPROv2. This optimizer can write (or improve) a program’s instructions. Let’s analyze the code below to learn what parts we must prepare to reach that goal of running MIPROv2 on task.\nFirst we pass translation_judge to the optimizer initialisation. This should be a function that must return a score between 0 (bad) to 1 (good). In DSPy these are called metrics. Almost every DSPy optimizer requires a metric. After we have 2 max_..._demos which are set to 0, this is because as a first run we would like to only optimise the text of the system prompt without adding few-shot examples. MIPROv2 can search for few-shot examples that would improve a program’s performance.\n\noptimizer = dspy.MIPROv2(translation_judge, max_bootstrapped_demos = 0, max_labeled_demos = 0)\nmy_program_optimized = optimizer.compile(my_program, trainset=trainset)\n\nSecond line of code, inside the compile method, we must give a DSPy program. This is not a string; it cannot be a system prompt. We will thus need to wrap up our system prompt + user/assistant simple LLM call into a lightweight program. And, finally, we have the trainset. In DSPy, this must be a list of dspy.Example objects. This is the object that all of DSPy’s internals are using, so there is no way around it; we must format our input/output training set as dspy.Example.\nIn summary, we need: 1. a metric 2. a program 3. a training set\nand we must format those appropriately.\nLet’s first tackle the training set as it is quite straightforward"

    "text": "Training set\nThe Example() object can take any arguments. You can think of those as column names in a dataframe or “keys” in JSON. It is usually pretty important to consider these names thoughtfully and normally DSPy will present them to the LLM as part of the prompts. In our case, that is a behavior from DSPy that we will change, so it does not matter what we call them. I decided to go with something very general. The prompt will be the user message and the generation will be the assistant message.\n\nimport dspy\n\nexamples = [\n    dspy.Example(prompt=\"I'm going to the convenience store.\", generation=\"Je m'en vais au dépanneur.\"),\n    dspy.Example(prompt=\"It's really cold out today.\", generation=\"Il fait frette en maudit aujourd'hui.\"),\n    dspy.Example(prompt=\"Can you help me move this weekend?\", generation=\"Tu peux m'aider à déménager ce weekend?\"),\n    dspy.Example(prompt=\"We were stuck in traffic for two hours.\", generation=\"On était pognés dans le trafic pendant deux heures.\"),\n    dspy.Example(prompt=\"She's my girlfriend.\", generation=\"C'est ma blonde.\"),\n    dspy.Example(prompt=\"That car is so cool!\", generation=\"C'est ben l'fun ce char-là!\"),\n    dspy.Example(prompt=\"I'll call you tonight.\", generation=\"Je vais t'appeler ce soir.\"),\n    dspy.Example(prompt=\"He's always bragging.\", generation=\"Il se vente tout l'temps.\"),\n    dspy.Example(prompt=\"We grabbed a coffee at Tim's.\", generation=\"On a pris un café au Tim.\"),\n    dspy.Example(prompt=\"Close the window, it's chilly.\", generation=\"Ferme la fenêtre, y fait frette.\"),\n    dspy.Example(prompt=\"I have an appointment at 3.\", generation=\"J'ai un rendez-vous à trois heures.\"),\n    dspy.Example(prompt=\"They're celebrating their birthday.\", generation=\"Ils fêtent leur fête.\"),\n    dspy.Example(prompt=\"I parked in the back.\", generation=\"J'ai stationné dans l'fond.\"),\n    dspy.Example(prompt=\"The metro is packed.\", generation=\"Le métro est plein à craquer.\"),\n    dspy.Example(prompt=\"We watched a movie last night.\", generation=\"On a écouté un film hier soir.\"),\n    dspy.Example(prompt=\"I need to do my groceries.\", generation=\"J'dois faire mon épicerie.\"),\n    dspy.Example(prompt=\"Don't forget your boots.\", generation=\"Oublie pas tes bottes.\"),\n    dspy.Example(prompt=\"It's snowing again.\", generation=\"Il neige encore.\"),\n    dspy.Example(prompt=\"I'll take the bus.\", generation=\"J'va prendre l'bus.\"),\n    dspy.Example(prompt=\"We're out of milk.\", generation=\"On est à court de lait.\"),\n]\n\nBefore we are done with our training set we must do 1 more little thing:\n\ntrainset = [x.with_inputs('prompt') for x in examples]\n\nThis, again, is something we have to do because of DSPy’s general powerful nature. Briefly, it is used by DSPy’s code internally to know what fields of the Example object are input fields for the LLM. It helps internal development to separate inputs from outputs. In our case, we just need to know that we have to do it, and so we do.\nLet’s move on to the Metric now!"

Despite that, we will get pretty good results, you will see.\nIn essence, all this code does is search for some very common French words that are not also common English words. If any of the words are found, the function returns a 1; otherwise it returns a 0.\n\nimport re\n\ndef is_french(text):\n    # Naive French detector: check for common French words/accents\n    french_markers = [\n        r\"\\b(le|la|les|un|une|des|du|de|et|à|est|sont|avec|pour|sur|par|mais|ou|où|que|qui|quand|comment|nous|vous|ils|elles|ça|ce|cette|ces)\\b\",\n        r\"[éèêàùçîôâœëïü]\",\n    ]\n    return any(re.search(marker, text.lower()) for marker in french_markers)\n\ndef translation_judge(example, prediction, trace=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Return 1.0 if the output looks French, else 0.0.\n    Doing the cast explicitly guarantees we never hand DSPy a None.\n    \"\"\"\n    output = prediction.get(\"generation\", \"\") or \"\"\n    try:\n        return float(is_french(output))\n    except Exception:\n        # Anything weird is just a miss\n        return 0.0\n\nNotice how translation_judge takes 3 arguments: example, prediction, and trace.\n\nexample will essentially be an instance of the Example() object as we defined above.\nprediction will be the parsed LLM output. Usually DSPy can do a lot here, but we will modify and simplify that part too.\ntrace can be ignored except when we want models to generate good examples themselves. This is called bootstrapping, and in that case, if trace is not None, we must return a boolean for whether the LLM-generated example is good (1) or not (0). This could be used, for instance, to make our list of translation pairs longer.\n\nMoving on the the program now!"

How can I help you today?\". The culprit for the additions is DSPy’s adapter. The adapter is amazing at turning a DSPy signature into an AI program, but right now, it’s in the way.\nLet’s replace DSPy’s adapter with our own simplified version."

    "text": "Making a Simple Custom Adapter\nAdapters are DSPy’s interface to the LLMs. They are called with a few pieces of information, and DSPy expects a parsed LLM generation to be returned. The following is the simplest we can make an adapter. We are taking in the LM that DSPy’s internals want us to use, keyword arguments if any, a signature, demos, and inputs.\nThe signature can contain only 3 things: instructions, inputs, and outputs. In our case, we have “canned” the signature, so we also know that the input is named prompt and the output is named generation, simplifying our requirements for our adapter substantially from what DSPy usually has to worry about.\n\n# Define the SimplestAdapter as before\nclass SimplestAdapter(dspy.Adapter):\n    def __call__(self, lm, lm_kwargs, signature, demos, inputs):\n        print(inputs)\n        system_content = signature.instructions\n        if demos:\n            system_content\n        messages = [\n            {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_content},\n            {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": inputs[\"prompt\"]},\n        ]\n        outputs = lm(messages=messages, **lm_kwargs)\n        return [{\"generation\": outputs[0]}]\n\n# Do NOT call dspy.configure(adapter=SimplestAdapter())\n# Subclass Predict to use the custom adapter only for this instance\nclass MyPredict(dspy.Predict):\n    def forward(self, **kwargs):\n        adapter = SimplestAdapter()\n        with dspy.settings.context(adapter=adapter):\n            return super().forward(**kwargs)\n\nWe also have to subclass dspy.Predict so that we are able to make a program that uses our adapter. Usually in DSPy, the adapter is set globally or within a scoped context, but in both cases, the adapter is applied recursively. This has the effect of making some DSPy programs inside the optimizer use our simple adapter, causing them all to break. And breaking everything is generally not good…\n\nmy_program = MyPredict(signature)"

    "text": "The promise\nThe fastest path to robust AI systems is to nail the intent1 of every component independently of its implementation. Get that right and you can swap, combine, or optimise implementations at will—without huges headaches.\n1 Intent is the underlying purpose or goal behind a task or component. Unlike a rigid task specification, intent acknowledges an inherent fuzziness—it represents direction and motivation. A task specification is merely one concrete attempt to clarify intent; each refinement of the specification moves us closer to accurately capturing the true intent.\nNobody will disagree that, as coders2, we now have a powerful new tool at our disposal: AI (and I am not refering to coding with AI but rather about putting AI component in our code). However, such power does not come for free, and if code is not crafted with care, things can quickly get ugly.\nThese days, in coding, I see four main paradigms for building a program that solve a task:\nThe fourth path is overwhelmingly powerful. Its lone cost is cognitive and architectural complexity. However, this complexity and the builder psychology in facing that complexity can be enough to wipe out all of the promised benefits of the compound approach if one is not careful in how one builds. Using any of the three and, potentially, their combination means that you must be skilled at all of them. It also means that you will have to learn and worry about design patterns and the tradeoffs of each, and if you mix all three (or even any of the 3 with itself) all in one long linear flat logical flow, you may lose the edge that the combination promised because you will quickly be slowed down by the complexity. Therefore you must build with care. Build with intent (task specification) at the forefront, and you will be handsomely rewarded."

    "text": "What does it mean to build with intent at the forefront?\nAnother way to say “build with intent” is: “specify each task’s components and their success criteria (evals), independently from their chosen implementation”. Doing that will enable you to quickly evaluate a task-completing-artifact and compose then together modularly. Thus letting you build programs as logical sequence of clearly defined tasks, where the specifics of implementation are unimportant (all you care about is that they follow the specs and pass the success criteria). This is not a very novel or revolutionary idea; I am essentially suggesting that you keep things modular but modularity is not quite enough. An important addition is that, due to the stochastic nature of AI components, the success criteria is essential and no longer as simple as writing a simple test or executing the program bug free.\nPreviously, each modular component was deterministic, mostly transparent, understandable, and—crucially—testable. Introducing machine learning and large language models (LLMs) into your system means accepting and incorporating stochasticity. To embrace machine learning and LLMs is to embrace and introduce stochasticity into your system. This means that the traditional ‘does it work?’ question is changed to ‘how well does it work’ and each component has its own performance spectrum. It is thus crucial that a success criteria, evaluated through a set of example task inputs and outputs, and metrics be defined along with task input and output specification. Once you do that, you are truly ready to be careless about the internals of the task completing system. All you need to know is that, when given inputs of a certain type and profile, outputs of required types and characteristics come out at a performance level that you can evaluate and check for ‘passing’ your performance threshold requirements. This decoupling is extremely liberating and powerful as we can swap, modify, optimize the component independently and with confidence."

They can specify it very clearly using a combination of the following:\n\nExamples (demonstrating what to do or not to do)\nInputs/Outputs specifications\nMetrics/Evaluations/Rubrics/Judges/Scores*\n\nStories/Instructions/Hints/Personas (analogies: “give me a recipe like Gordon Ramsay would”)\n\nIn theory, any single element might suffice for an intelligent entity to complete the task.\n\nTranslating from English text into French Canadian\nConsider the task of translating English text into French Canadian:\n\nExamples\nThe following should be enough for a talented human to find the pattern and comply:\n\nexample_of_success = {\n    'english': [\n        \"I'm going to the convenience store.\",\n        \"It's really cold out today.\",\n        \"Can you help me move this weekend?\",\n        \"We were stuck in traffic for two hours.\",\n        \"She's my girlfriend.\",\n        \"That car is so cool!\",\n        \"I'll call you tonight.\",\n        \"He's always bragging.\",\n        \"We grabbed a coffee at Tim's.\",\n        \"Close the window, it's chilly.\",\n        \"I have an appointment at 3.\",\n        \"They're celebrating their birthday.\",\n        \"I parked in the back.\",\n        \"The metro is packed.\",\n        \"We watched a movie last night.\",\n        \"I need to do my groceries.\",\n        \"Don't forget your boots.\",\n        \"It's snowing again.\",\n        \"I'll take the bus.\",\n        \"We're out of milk.\"\n    ],\n    'french': [\n        \"Je m'en vais au dépanneur.\",\n        \"Il fait frette en maudit aujourd'hui.\",\n        \"Tu peux m'aider à déménager ce weekend?\",\n        \"On était pognés dans le trafic pendant deux heures.\",\n        \"C'est ma blonde.\",\n        \"C'est ben l'fun ce char-là!\",\n        \"Je vais t'appeler ce soir.\",\n        \"Il se vente tout l'temps.\",\n        \"On a pris un café au Tim.\",\n        \"Ferme la fenêtre, y fait frette.\",\n        \"J'ai un rendez-vous à trois heures.\",\n        \"Ils fêtent leur fête.\",\n        \"J'ai stationné dans l'fond.\",\n        \"Le métro est plein à craquer.\",\n        \"On a écouté un film hier soir.\",\n        \"J'dois faire mon épicerie.\",\n        \"Oublie pas tes bottes.\",\n        \"Il neige encore.\",\n        \"J'va prendre l'bus.\",\n        \"On est à court de lait.\"\n    ]\n}\n\nHowever, for other intelligent systems, additional clarifications like instructions, judges, or input/output schemas might be necessary.\n\n\nInstruction\nSimilarly to examples, these instructions could be sufficient:\n\nTranslate the following English sentences into colloquial Quebec French. Preserve the informal, spoken register—use contractions, regional vocabulary (e.g., “dépanneur”, “frette”, “blonde”), and typical Quebec French syntax. Do not translate proper nouns like “Tim’s” or anglicisms that are common in Quebec French (e.g., “weekend”). Keep the tone casual and conversational.\n\n\n\nJudge or metric\nOr if you have a metric or a performance LLM judge you can build an example set using them by searching for high scoring examples. A metric using code could hypothetically be built, like that:\n\nis_quebec_form = []\nfor word in translated_text:\n    if word in quebec_colloquial_word_set:\n        is_quebec_form.append(1)\n    else:\n        is_quebec_form.append(0)\nmean(is_quebec_form)\n\nOr, perhaps, more easily for this task a judge LLM could be tuned and used:\n\nYou are an expert Quebec French linguist. For each English sentence and its proposed French translation, evaluate:\n\nAccuracy: Does the French convey the same meaning as the English?\nRegister: Is the tone appropriately informal/colloquial (not formal textbook French)?\nRegional Vocabulary: Does it use authentic Quebec French terms (e.g., “dépanneur”, “frette”, “blonde”)?\nContractions: Are natural Quebec French contractions used (e.g., “j’va”, “t’”, “y’a”)?\nProper Nouns: Are names like “Tim’s” left untranslated?\nAnglicisms: Are common Quebec anglicisms preserved when appropriate (e.g., “weekend”)? Score each translation from 1-5 on these criteria, with 5 being perfect. Provide brief feedback on any issues.\n\n\n\n\nTask input/output\nOften, if you are told what you will be given to complete a certain task and what you must return, it is enough for you to understand the intent of the person giving you the task.\nInput/Output specification could look something like that:\n\n\nInput: A plain-text string in English.\nOutput: Plain-text colloquial Quebec French sentence, using regional vocabulary, contractions, and anglicisms common in spoken Quebec French.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that, in building systems with AI components there are, confusingly, at least two input and output types. That is:\n\nthe inputs and outputs of the task-completing-system\n\nthe inputs and outputs of the LLM, often times, inside the task completing system3\n\n\n\n3 sometimes for LLM performance reason we may want to give it a role/persona, some fewshots examples, maybe a list of tools that would not generally need to be specified to a human or any other system completing the task, or maybe a generating strategy like think step-by-step, all of those are LLM inputs but not task inputs. Some extra LLM outputs would include thinking traces, tool calling traces, etc.\n\nArtifacts\nArtifacts4 can also specify or at least contribute to specifying a task intent. This one is somewhat special compared to the other specification mechanisms we just went through as there are 2 types of artifacts and they are both indirect specification mechanisms, meaning from the artifact we can deduce specifications. There are opaque and there are transparent artifacts. An opaque artifact (black box deep neural net) acts similarly to examples but might lead to misuse. A transparent, understandable artifact contributes significantly to task clarity, enabling extraction of instructions, examples, input/output pairs, and potentially training judges (open source program or mathematical formula). While an understandable artifact can greatly help in specifying the task it does not, however, resolve the task permanently, as future needs may require efficiency improvements or different dependencies.\n4 meaning a thing that successfully completes the task"

    "text": "How do you do Intent-Oriented Programming?\nI am not sure anybody yet completely knows how to do that but here is my current thinking on this.\n\nTask Specification Object\nFirst, you need to have a place where you define task specifications, there should be one source of truth for each task. This could be in a separate file, or a separate section in a file or a separate module, etc. Let’s call that a Task Specification Object. A task specification object would contain all the above-mentioned elements, and they would have versioning (à la git) and attributions. Were the instructions deduced? If so, from what and by what?\nOne should be careful with the task specification object, as there is a fine line between specifying a task and optimizing a system that aims to complete the task successfully. A specification should be general; it should aim to be coherent, and brevity is better than verbosity. Anything that would not help the majority of intelligent entities interpret the task and successfully complete it should be a concern for the optimizer.\n\n\nCompiler\nThen, we will need a place where you turn a task spec into something that, at the very least, attempts to complete the task. The action necessary to go from task spec to a program that tentatively completes the task could be referred to as compiling. In the sense that you are compiling a task spec into a program, the system performing that action could be called a compiler. Generally, that compiler would need to be told what particular AI component to target (analogous to hardware components5). In most cases, the target is a model paired with a provider endpoint, where the model could be weights on your computer and the provider could be your own inference code; but often, it would be a commercial provider (e.g., Groq, Cerebras, Bedrock, OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, Ollama, vLLM, etc.) along with a model ID (generally a string).\n5 as with hardware AI components, especially neural networks or external APIs, are notable for: Limited flexibility regarding accepted inputs, Limited flexibility in output structure or format. Complex constraints often accepted due to their significant value and leverage. High ressource requirement and bottlenecking, necessitating careful management.Within the compiler task specifications and optimization flags will combined using adapters into a specific prompt and format to interface with the AI component.\n\nOptimization flags\nOptimization is a process where you take a working system, meaning it can in theory go from inputs to outputs, but it does not currently do so in a satisfactory way. It is not optimization to define and construct the task-completing system. Upon compiling, optimization flags can be provided. For instance, few-shot demos could be added into the prompt, or an AI persona could be defined. The same goes for a specific type of generation such as ‘think step by step,’ and the style of adapter, using JSON or XML, or even a compilation flag for triggering the fine-tuning of model weights using appropriate hyperparameters and training set, etc. Those are compilation tags that are too specific to a certain compilation and model to be in the specification, but they are nevertheless extremely important and powerful to drive an AI component’s performance.\n\n\nAdapters\nAdapters handle practical issues that arise when interfacing general system logic with specialized AI components. Their role is to abstract away friction caused by specific constraints or idiosyncrasies of powerful but less flexible AI component interfaces.\nAs just discussed in the optimization section, sometimes for LLM performance reasons we may want to give it a role or persona, some few-shot examples, maybe a list of tools in addition to elements from the Task Specification Object. It is the task of a formatting adapter to bring all those together for the LLM input interface. Similarly, AI outputs must be parsed into the output required by the task alongside some extra LLM outputs which may be beneficial for performance or monitoring reasons. For instance, an LLM could produce thinking traces, tool calling traces, etc.\nIn short, adapters primarily manage two areas:\n\nInput Formatting: Converting inputs into the precise formats AI models expect (tokenization, padding, embedding formats, API call structures).\nOutput Parsing: Interpreting and translating model outputs back into clearly specified, structured forms suitable for downstream processing or evaluation.\n\nAdapters simplify the logical composition and enable developers and AI practitioners to concentrate on specifying tasks clearly rather than managing cumbersome AI-specific plumbing.\n\n\nThe compilers’ advantage\nUltimatly given a task specification, optimization flags and AI component target, a program can be compiled automatically thanks to the compiler picking previously defined adapters (formatters or parsers) and the resulting program can be evaluated using a combination of judge, metric, and example set. That is how I would build programs that use AI for completing their tasks. This has the advantage of opening the door to optimization, and easily and confidently changing AI component target.\n\n\n\nAI program composition\nOrthogonally to the compilation of AI programs from task specification, you can compose those AI programs together in very powerful, maintainable and very importantly ever improving systems. As a new AI component comes out you can easily change the compilation target, evaluate and if satisfactory change to the improved AI component."

    "text": "Conclusion\nTo build systems that age well, treat every task as a contract: state what must happen, not how. Encode that contract in a single, versioned Task-Spec Object—examples, metrics, I/O schemas, and nothing more. Hand it to a compiler that knows how to translate the contract into calls to whatever AI component (LLM, model, or rule engine) happens to be fastest, cheapest or most accurate today. Let adapters absorb the messy realities of tokens, JSON quirks, rate limits. Measure against the specifications; this keeps the door open for painless swaps when better models appear."

I then wondered: ‘what would they need to build for their program to be an AI program?’ I think the answer is they need to have AI contributing to the control flow of the application. A nice way to illustrate that is to have an AI deciding where my prompt goes in a growing tree of conversations instead of having code and buttons decide that.\nIn this blog we will build a complete and working branching chat application. My intuition is that this is an important piece missing to AI chat currently.

    "text": "Conversation Router\nThe conversation router is responsible for taking our prompt and the conversation tree and finding where our prompt should attach itself to the tree.\nIn my original system, I used some sort of tournament and weighted the relevance of the roots and the tips, and for the top X most relevant conversation trace I would look inside the conversations and try to find the point of connection. Doing something hierarchical like that would help the solution scale to a very big tree. Here we will keep it VERY simple; we will rank and evaluate the relevance of each all possible conversation traces of at most 3 turns at once (in a sort of sliding window).\n\nCollecting & rendering traces to string\nIn our conversation_tree class definition above we created a method to collect the turns above a given turn, so we can do that here.\n\ntraces = []\nfor (id, i_turn) in conversation_tree.turns.items():\n    traces.append(conversation_tree.trace_upward(turn_id=id, depth=3))\n\nprint(traces[0])\n\n[Turn(turn_id=0, parent_turn_id=None, user='Help me understand gravity.', assistant='Gravity is the force...', children_ids=[1, 3])]\n\n\nIn the case of the first trace (the one printed just above here), the turn in question had no parent, so a trace of one turn was returned. This is what we want. The subsequent turn was a turn just below turn 0, so we get two turns in that trace: turn 0 and turn 1, and so on for all turns in the tree.\n\nprint(traces[1])\n\n[Turn(turn_id=0, parent_turn_id=None, user='Help me understand gravity.', assistant='Gravity is the force...', children_ids=[1, 3]), Turn(turn_id=1, parent_turn_id=0, user=\"What's the difference between Newton's and Einstein's theories of gravity?\", assistant='Newton pictured gravity...', children_ids=[2])]\n\n\nWe could probably show these to the LLM, but I think we can render them into something a little more readable. Something like this:\n&lt;trace id=\"2\"&gt;\n\n\n## User: \n    Help me understand gravity.\n\n## Assistant: \n    Gravity is the force...\n\n## User: \n    you said Gravity is the force that pulls any two pieces of matter, can you show me the formula\n\n## Assistant: \n    Newton’s universal law...\n&lt;/trace&gt;\n\n&lt;trace id=\"3\"&gt;\n\n\n## User: \n    Give me a good recipe for a vegan pasta sauce.\n\n## Assistant: \n    Creamy Tomato-Basil Vegan Pasta Sauce...\n\n## User: \n    For the recipe, I don't like onion can you improve\n\n## Assistant: \n    Creamy Tomato-Basil Vegan Pasta Sauce (No-Onion Version)...\n&lt;/trace&gt;\nHere is the code to do that for all of them at once and get one big string for the llm.\n\ndef format_trace(trace: List[Turn]) -&gt; str:\n    trace_string = \"\"\n    for turn in trace:\n        trace_string += \"\\n\\n## User: \\n\\t\" + turn.user + \\\n                        \"\\n\\n## Assistant: \\n\\t\" + turn.assistant + \"\\n\"\n    return trace_string\n\ndef format_traces_with_id(traces):\n    count = 0\n    all_traces_string = \"\"\n    for trace in traces:\n        count += 1\n        all_traces_string += f\"&lt;trace_id = {count}&gt;\\n\" + \\\n                                    format_trace(trace)+ \\\n                             f\"\\n&lt;/trace_id = {count}&gt;\\n\"\n    return all_traces_string \n    \nstringi_traces = format_traces_with_id(traces)\n\n\n\nBuild the ranking program\nNow that we have all conversation segments (traces), we can rank them by relevance.\nWe’ll feed the LLM the user’s prompt and all the segments, and ask for three things back: a rank (1 is best), a relevance score from 0 to 1, and a temporary trace ID so we know which score belongs to which segment.\nThat gives us:\n\nInputs:\n\ncurrent user prompt (string)\n\ntraces (string)\n\nOutputs:\n\na sorted list of evaluations, each with rank (int), trace id (int), relevance score (float 0–1)\n\n\nLet’s turn this into a DSPy program. First, define a class that tells DSPy and the LLM exactly what to return.\n\nclass SegmentEvaluation(pydantic.BaseModel):\n    trace_id: int\n    relevance_to_prompt: float\n    ranked_relevance_to_prompt: int\n\nNow we are finally using DSPy!\nlet’s import it:\n\nimport dspy\n\nHere we write our program’s instructions, inputs and outputs as a DSPy signature. In DSPy, the signature takes the place of the usual prompt. In the signature we can use the docstring to give instructions. This instruction will be added to a system prompt behind the scenes before calling the llm1. Other than the signature you have Inputs and Outputs. These are defined by creating attributes in the class you are creating and making those equal to either InputField or OutputField. The name that you give to the attributes will be shown to the llm. These will be added to the system prompt where their name, type and description is spelled out. They will also be used in the user messages and the llm will be instructed to use them2.\n1 although we won’t be running any DSPy optimizer in this tutorial, the instruction part of the signature is the main element that the optimizers can modify and improve2 the inputs and outputs fields are NOT modified by DSPy optimizers, they are simply ‘rendered’ into a text prompt by DSPy’s adapters\nclass EvaluateSegments(dspy.Signature):\n    \"\"\"Evaluate a conversation segments for relevance to a new prompt.\n\n    For each segment, identify if has topical connection to the user prompt. Consider if the prompt is:\n    - A direct follow-up question.\n    - A request for clarification.\n    - An exploration of a related sub-topic.\n    - A completely different subject.\n    \n    Assign a relevance score from 0.0 (completely irrelevant) to 1.0 (a direct continuation of the topic).\n    You will also rank the segments where 1 is the most relevant of the group\n    \"\"\"\n    #Inputs\n    user_prompt: str = dspy.InputField(desc=\"The new user prompt to be integrated.\")\n    segments_to_evaluate: str = dspy.InputField(desc=\"A stringified list of conversation segments, each with its trace_id and content.\")\n    \n    #Outputs\n    evaluations: List[SegmentEvaluation] = dspy.OutputField(desc=\"A list of evaluations, one for each segment, including detailed reasoning.\")\n\nNow to make that signature callable we have to make it into a module3. The simplest one is dspy.Predict, let’s use that.\n3 there are lots of off the shelf modules in DSPy and you can, should, and will define your own. Modules are where you define the logic and control flow around the llm calls. Modules are often called Programs and DSPy’s optimizers can optimize whole modules and modules inside of modules and so on all the way down\nrelevance_evaluator = dspy.Predict(EvaluateSegments)\n\nWe are almost ready to call an AI but we first need to set up our language model.\nConnecting to different models and providers in DSPy is very easy. You just have to change groq/moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct for the path to the provider and model you want. Behind the scenes, DSPy uses litellm so this path is one that would work with litellm4\n4 for instance you could do gpt-4.1, or ollama/&lt;ollama_model&gt;\nlm = dspy.LM(\"groq/moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct\")\ndspy.configure(lm = lm)\n\n\nevaluation = relevance_evaluator(\n    user_prompt = \"how much salt should I use?\",\n    segments_to_evaluate = format_traces_with_id(traces)\n)\nevaluation\n\nPrediction(\n    evaluations=[SegmentEvaluation(trace_id=1, relevance_to_prompt=0.0, ranked_relevance_to_prompt=9), SegmentEvaluation(trace_id=2, relevance_to_prompt=0.0, ranked_relevance_to_prompt=8), SegmentEvaluation(trace_id=3, relevance_to_prompt=0.0, ranked_relevance_to_prompt=7), SegmentEvaluation(trace_id=4, relevance_to_prompt=0.0, ranked_relevance_to_prompt=6), SegmentEvaluation(trace_id=5, relevance_to_prompt=0.4, ranked_relevance_to_prompt=5), SegmentEvaluation(trace_id=6, relevance_to_prompt=0.6, ranked_relevance_to_prompt=4), SegmentEvaluation(trace_id=7, relevance_to_prompt=0.0, ranked_relevance_to_prompt=3), SegmentEvaluation(trace_id=8, relevance_to_prompt=0.0, ranked_relevance_to_prompt=2), SegmentEvaluation(trace_id=9, relevance_to_prompt=0.0, ranked_relevance_to_prompt=1)]\n)\n\n\nDSPy always returns a Prediction5. Let’s get our list of evaluations out of evaluation. Since we used type hints to tell DSPy that we wanted List[SegmentEvaluation], it made sure this is what we got6\n5 Predictions are necessary because some programs add to your outputs and you may have multiple outputs6 If you are working with a smaller model, the model may struggle to output the required structure, using TwoStepAdapter may help dspy.configure(lm = lm, adapter = dspy.TwoStepAdapter(lm))\nevaluation.evaluations\n\n[SegmentEvaluation(trace_id=1, relevance_to_prompt=0.0, ranked_relevance_to_prompt=9),\n SegmentEvaluation(trace_id=2, relevance_to_prompt=0.0, ranked_relevance_to_prompt=8),\n SegmentEvaluation(trace_id=3, relevance_to_prompt=0.0, ranked_relevance_to_prompt=7),\n SegmentEvaluation(trace_id=4, relevance_to_prompt=0.0, ranked_relevance_to_prompt=6),\n SegmentEvaluation(trace_id=5, relevance_to_prompt=0.4, ranked_relevance_to_prompt=5),\n SegmentEvaluation(trace_id=6, relevance_to_prompt=0.6, ranked_relevance_to_prompt=4),\n SegmentEvaluation(trace_id=7, relevance_to_prompt=0.0, ranked_relevance_to_prompt=3),\n SegmentEvaluation(trace_id=8, relevance_to_prompt=0.0, ranked_relevance_to_prompt=2),\n SegmentEvaluation(trace_id=9, relevance_to_prompt=0.0, ranked_relevance_to_prompt=1)]\n\n\nLet’s now find the most relevant turn\n\nbest_eval = max(evaluation.evaluations, key=lambda x: x.relevance_to_prompt)\nmost_relevevant_turn = traces[best_eval.trace_id-1][-1]\nmost_relevevant_turn\n\nTurn(turn_id=5, parent_turn_id=4, user=\"For the recipe, I don't like onion can you improve\", assistant='Creamy Tomato-Basil Vegan Pasta Sauce (No-Onion Version)...', children_ids=[])\n\n\nWe have our first LLM-generated data!\n\n\nConnection decision\nWe will now be using that in our program logic and control flow.

So let’s make a second program, one that will look at the most relevant conversation segment and decide if it attaches there or starts a new conversation\n\nclass NewChatDecision(dspy.Signature):\n    \"\"\"\n    You are a classifier inside of an automatically branching chat application.\n    The most relevant branch in a conversation tree has been identified. \n    Given that conversation and a user prompt, you must decide if we should start a new conversation\n    or if we should attach the prompt the most relevant conversation.\n    \"\"\"\n    user_prompt: str = dspy.InputField()\n    relevance_score: float = dspy.InputField()\n    conversation: str = dspy.InputField()\n    decision: bool = dspy.OutputField(desc = \"Return true for a new conversation, false to attach to this conversation\")\n\nJust like for the conversation relevance ranker, we turn our signature into a callable program with Predict and we run the program.\n\nnew_chat_decider = dspy.Predict(NewChatDecision)\ndecision = new_chat_decider(\n    user_prompt = \"how much salt should I use?\",\n    relevance_score = best_eval.relevance_to_prompt,\n    conversation = format_trace(conversation_tree.trace_upward(most_relevevant_turn.turn_id, 100)), \n)\ndecision\n\nPrediction(\n    decision=False\n)\n\n\nKimi-K2, our AI, suggests that we do NOT start a new conversation. So we would then add our current prompt to that conversation trace and send the query to a simple chat program.\n\n\nChat bot\n\nclass ChatBot(dspy.Signature):\n    \"\"\"You are a helpful assistant\"\"\"\n    history: dspy.History = dspy.InputField()\n    user_prompt: str = dspy.InputField()\n    assistant_response: str = dspy.OutputField()\n\nOur chatbot will need the conversation history to properly respond so let’s create a message list. DSPy offers History, a DSPy Type to help us with that. It will turn the history into actual user and assistant messages for us even though we did not use the expected role name.\n\nmessages = []\nfor turn in conversation_tree.trace_upward(most_relevevant_turn.turn_id, 100):\n    messages.append({\"user_prompt\": turn.user, \"assistant_response\": turn.assistant})\nmessages\n\n[{'user_prompt': 'Give me a good recipe for a vegan pasta sauce.',\n  'assistant_response': 'Creamy Tomato-Basil Vegan Pasta Sauce...'},\n {'user_prompt': \"For the recipe, I don't like onion can you improve\",\n  'assistant_response': 'Creamy Tomato-Basil Vegan Pasta Sauce (No-Onion Version)...'}]\n\n\n\nchat = dspy.Predict(ChatBot)\nresponse = chat(\n    history = dspy.History(messages=messages),\n    user_prompt = \"how much salt should I use?\"\n)\nresponse\n\nPrediction(\n    assistant_response='For the no-onion creamy tomato-basil vegan pasta sauce we’ve been working on, start with **½ teaspoon of fine sea salt** when you first add the tomatoes.

No more lost context or jarring restarts—just conversations that pick up exactly where they left off, every single time."

I was excited about DSPy, but I thought I would need a substantial time investment before I could “get it.” That’s not the case! It took me one hour. If you know Python, in an hour you’ll either have built several LLM programs, or you’ll have built one, benchmarked it, and optimized it!\nIn this article, we’ll go through the entire cycle: building a program, creating a gold set (synthetically, with AI—and yes, it’s actually useful, not just contrived!), and evaluating the results.\nFor this article, our task will be to build a program that can count the mentions of “Artificial Intelligence,” “AI,” or any other ways of referring to AI."

    "title": "A Simple Introduction to DSPy",
    "section": "Step 1: Define the AI Task Signature",
    "text": "Step 1: Define the AI Task Signature\nIn DSPy, we define the task using a Signature class instead of writing prompts manually. DSPy provides two ways for you to specify your program. This is the shortest method. In this case, it has four parts:\n\ndspy.Predict: This could have been dspy.ChainOfThought; it lets you specify the “strategy” the LLM should use. Predict is the vanilla option—no special strategy is mentioned in the prompt that DSPy sends to the LLM.\nInput (“paragraph”): This tells the LLM that it will receive a “paragraph” as input.\nOutput (“ai_occurrences_count”): This tells the LLM that it will have to output the “AI occurrences count.”\nOutput Type (“float”): This specifies that the output should be a float—nothing else.\n\n\nimport dspy\n\n\nai_counter = dspy.Predict(\"paragraph -&gt; ai_occurrences_count: float\")\n\nYou can specify more. To fully define your program, you would use the class syntax (see the chunk below). In this case, you can add general instructions and descriptions to the fields (inputs and/or outputs).\n\nimport dspy\n\n# Setup the llm\ndspy.configure(lm=dspy.LM('gemini/gemini-2.0-flash-lite', temperature = 1.0, max_tokens = 6000))\n\n# This define the signature of the AI function. The replaces prompts.\nclass count_ai_occurrences(dspy.Signature):\n    \"\"\"Count the number times the word 'Artificial Intelligence'\n    or 'AI' or any other reference to AI or AI-related terms appears in the paragraph\"\"\"\n    paragraph: str= dspy.InputField(desc = \"The paragraph to count the AI mentions in\")\n    ai_occurrences_count: int= dspy.OutputField(desc = \"The number of times the word 'Artificial Intelligence' or 'AI' appears in the paragraph\")\n\ndspy_module = dspy.Predict(count_ai_occurrences)\n\nThis signature will be turned into the following prompt by DSPy:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"role\": \"system\",\n    \"content\": \"\"\"Your input fields are:\n  1. `paragraph` (str): The paragraph to count the AI mentions in\n\nYour output fields are:\n  1. `ai_occurrences_count` (int): Number of times 'Artificial Intelligence'\n     or 'AI' appears in the paragraph\n\nFormat all interactions like this, filling in the values:\n\n[[ ## paragraph ## ]]\n{paragraph}\n\n[[ ## ai_occurrences_count ## ]]\n{ai_occurrences_count}   # must be a single int value\n\n[[ ## completed ## ]]\n\nObjective:\n  Count the number times the word 'Artificial Intelligence'\n    or 'AI' or any other reference to AI or AI-related terms appears in the paragraph.\"\"\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"user\",\n    \"content\": \"\"\"[[ ## paragraph ## ]]\nThis is a paragraph mentioning AI once.\n\nRespond with the corresponding output fields, starting with\n[[ ## ai_occurrences_count ## ]] (must be a valid Python int),\nthen end with [[ ## completed ## ]].\n\"\"\"\n  }\n]\n\nOk, so our program is defined! That’s it.\nThere’s one small thing I like to do—it’s entirely optional. I do it because I want to use my DSPy program more like a regular function. So, before I go ahead, I wrap it in a function:\ndef count_ai_occurrences_f(paragraph):\n    return dspy_module(paragraph=paragraph).ai_occurrences_count\nThe DSPy module requires keyword arguments and returns output as an object. Instead of repeatedly specifying my keyword arguments and the single output I want, I bake that in here. This also has the added benefit that my function now composes well with my data analytics tools, which expect not to provide a keyword argument or extract a value from an output object."

    "text": "Step 3: Applying the AI to our paragraphs\nNow we are starting to use large language models. Below, we apply our function to every row in our dataframe. In other words, we loop through each paragraph and send it to the LLM. The LLM returns the number of times it thinks “AI” was mentioned in the paragraph. The result from the LLM is extracted as a float. We store this in a new column of our dataframe, which we name flash_response.\ndf = mutate(df, flash_response = f.paragraphs.apply(count_ai_occurrences_f))\nThis column is now our baseline. This shows how Flash-lite performs with the base prompt from DSPy. Now, we want to optimize that prompt! For this, we need a gold set.\nI like to create gold sets with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models and then optimize the prompt to approximate the responses I would get from a SOTA model, but using a much smaller, faster, and cheaper model. In other words, we’ll provide a sample of our paragraphs to Sonnet 4 and then automatically “find a way” to prompt Flash-lite into responding like Sonnet would. This is extremely useful when you don’t know the answer yourself but know that SOTA models do—or at least they get it “right enough” for you to gain valuable insights.\nOk, so now we want to add a column with Sonnet’s answers.\nwith dspy.context(lm=dspy.LM('anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514')):\n    df_with_goldset_col = mutate(df, resp_sonnet = f.paragraphs.apply(count_ai_occurrences_f))\nThat’s it. Let’s break down those two lines. First, DSPy recommends using either dspy.context or dspy.configure to set the LLM. Both ways are fine and both are thread-safe. On the second line, we take our current dataframe, which now has two columns (paragraphs and flash_response), and loop through every value in paragraphs, passing each one to our AI program. We then save all of that in a new column called resp_sonnet, and the entire dataframe is stored as df_with_goldset_col.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGold Set Strategy\n\n\n\nUsing a SOTA model to create gold sets is a practical approach when you don’t have manually labeled data but trust that advanced models will perform well enough for your use case."

Here, we are purely in dataframe manipulation mode with Datar. Using the &gt;&gt; operator, we can pass the dataframe you see above (as it comes out of mutate) to the summarise function, which sums all the True values (1s) and divides by the number of rows.\nbaseline_metrics = (mutate(df_with_goldset_col, exact_match = f.resp_sonnet == f.flash_response) &gt;&gt;\n    summarise(baseline_precision = b.sum(f.exact_match)/n() * 100))\nThis tells us that we have 65% baseline precision with Flash-lite and this prompt."

In this case, if we were to keep it as is, we would be using Flash-lite to compose the prompts (whenever the optimizer we choose does that). I prefer to use a SOTA model for that, so we will set a teacher model. To set a teacher model on MIPROv2, use the teacher_settings keyword.

This base class doesn’t implement compile itself (inherits Teleprompter.compile which raises NotImplemented) – it is meant to be subclassed for fine-tuning behavior.\nNo direct compile method in this base class – subclasses implement the optimization logic. (It inherits the abstract compile signature from Teleprompter but does not override it, so it cannot be used standalone.)\n\n\nBootstrapFinetune\n__init__(self, metric=None, multitask=True, train_kwargs=None, adapter=None, exclude_demos=False, num_threads=None) – extends FinetuneTeleprompter. All arguments have defaults: metric (evaluation metric, default None), multitask (bool, True to fine-tune on combined data vs. per-predictor), train_kwargs (dict for training hyperparams, default None), adapter (optional Adapter or mapping for fine-tuning, default None), exclude_demos (bool, default False, whether to clear prompt demos after fine-tuning), num_threads (int, default None for using global default threads). These can be given as keywords or positionally (no * in signature).\ncompile(self, student, trainset, teacher=None, valset=None, target=\\\"t5-large\\\", bsize=12, accumsteps=1, lr=5e-5, epochs=1, bf16=False, int8=False, peft=False, path_prefix=None) – student and trainset are accepted as positional args (unlike others, this method does not strictly enforce keyword-only for trainset in the code). teacher is optional (default None, can be passed by name); valset optional (default None); and a series of fine-tuning hyperparameters are provided as keyword options with defaults (target model name, batch size bsize, gradient accumulation steps accumsteps, learning rate lr, epochs, and flags for bf16, int8, PEFT usage, plus path_prefix for saving checkpoints). (In practice, these would be passed as keywords; the lack of * means trainset and teacher could technically be given positionally, which is an inconsistency in interface.)\n\n\nCOPRO (Co-Prompt Optimization)\n__init__(self, prompt_model=None, metric=None, breadth=10, depth=3, init_temperature=1.4, track_stats=False) – all parameters have defaults. prompt_model is an LM used to generate prompt variations (defaults to the globally configured LM if None); metric is the evaluation metric (default None, meaning it will optimize without a specific metric filter unless provided); breadth (int) is how many new prompt candidates to generate per iteration (default 10); depth is how many iterations of prompt refinement to perform (default 3); init_temperature (float) for prompt generation randomness (default 1.4); track_stats (bool) whether to record optimization statistics (default False).\ncompile(self, student, *, trainset, eval_kwargs) – student program is positional; trainset is required keyword-only; eval_kwargs is also required keyword-only (a dict of extra arguments for evaluation). No teacher parameter in this optimizer – instead it uses prompt_model internally for generating new instructions, and evaluates the student on trainset using the provided metric and eval settings.\n\n\nMIPROv2 (Multi-Iteration Prompt Optimizer)\n__init__(self, metric, prompt_model=None, task_model=None, teacher_settings=None, max_bootstrapped_demos=4, max_labeled_demos=4, auto=\\\"light\\\", num_candidates=None, num_threads=None, max_errors=None, seed=9, init_temperature=0.5, verbose=False, track_stats=True, log_dir=None, metric_threshold=None) – a large number of parameters. Notably, metric is required (no default) – the primary evaluation metric. prompt_model and task_model are optional LM instances (if None, defaults to global settings for prompt generation and for executing the task, respectively). teacher_settings is an optional dict of LM settings for any teacher model usage (default None -&gt; {}). max_bootstrapped_demos and max_labeled_demos default to 4 each (controls how many few-shot examples of each type to use initially). auto can be \"light\", \"medium\", \"heavy\" or None, controlling an automatic configuration of search effort (default “light”). num_candidates (int, optional) specifies how many candidate prompt variations to generate (if auto is None, this must be set along with num_trials). num_threads optional (for parallel eval, default None). max_errors optional (max allowed errors during eval, default None to use global). seed default 9 (random seed for reproducibility). init_temperature (float) default 0.5 for initial prompt variation. verbose (bool) default False for logging. track_stats default True to record detailed stats. log_dir optional path for logging. metric_threshold optional float to early-discard prompts below this score threshold.\ncompile(self, student, *, trainset, teacher=None, valset=None, num_trials=None, max_bootstrapped_demos=None, max_labeled_demos=None, seed=None, minibatch=True, minibatch_size=35, minibatch_full_eval_steps=5, program_aware_proposer=True, data_aware_proposer=True, view_data_batch_size=10, tip_aware_proposer=True, fewshot_aware_proposer=True, requires_permission_to_run=True, provide_traceback=None) – student is positional; all other parameters are keyword-only. trainset (list of examples) is required; teacher optional (defaults None, a teacher program/LM for bootstrapping if needed); valset optional (if provided, used for evaluation phases). This method exposes many tuning knobs: num_trials (total search iterations, required if auto mode is None), the ability to override max_bootstrapped_demos/max_labeled_demos for this run, a seed (if not given, uses the seed from init), and several boolean flags controlling different proposer strategies (minibatch evaluation vs full dataset, with minibatch_size and how often to fully evaluate minibatch_full_eval_steps; whether the prompt proposal is aware of the program structure, data distribution, etc. via program_aware_proposer, data_aware_proposer, tip_aware_proposer, fewshot_aware_proposer – all True by default). view_data_batch_size (int, default 10) controls how much data a proposal sees at once. requires_permission_to_run (bool, default True) will prompt the user before a potentially expensive run. provide_traceback (bool or None) toggles including stack traces in logged errors. All of these are meant to be supplied as keywords when needed (there is a * enforcing keyword-only) to fine-tune the search behavior.\n\n\n\nTable Legend: Positional parameters are those that must be supplied in order (or by name), before any *. Keyword-only parameters (shown after *) can only be supplied by name (and have default values if not marked required). Defaults are shown where applicable. Each class’s core method (usually compile) is listed with its signature and the nature of its arguments."

    "section": "Detailed Method Argument Analysis",
    "text": "Detailed Method Argument Analysis\nBelow we provide a class-by-class breakdown of the constructor and primary method parameters, explaining each argument, default values, and usage conventions:\n\nTeleprompter (Base Class)\n\nConstructor Teleprompter.__init__: Takes no arguments besides self (no parameters to configure). It’s essentially an abstract base, so no initialization parameters are needed.\nMethod compile(self, student, *, trainset, teacher=None, valset=None): This is meant to be overridden by subclasses. It accepts a student program (the DSPy program to optimize) as a positional argument. The datasets are keyword-only:\n\ntrainset (required, list of Example): the training examples on which to optimize.\nteacher (optional, default None): an optional teacher program used to guide optimization (if not provided, many optimizers default to using the student itself or an internal strategy).\nvalset (optional, default None): an optional validation set of examples to evaluate generalization or for early stopping. All parameters after student are marked with * in the signature, making them keyword-only for clarity. The base implementation raises NotImplementedError (since Teleprompter itself doesn’t define a specific optimization strategy).\n\nMethod get_params(self): (Minor utility) Returns a dictionary of the Teleprompter’s internal attributes (simply self.__dict__). This is a common interface to retrieve the configuration of any Teleprompter.\n\n\n\nLabeledFewShot\n\nConstructor LabeledFewShot.__init__(self, k=16): This optimizer’s only parameter is k – the number of examples from the trainset to label (i.e. use as demonstrations) per predictor. It defaults to 16. This parameter is positional-or-keyword (not forced to keyword-only), so one could call LabeledFewShot(10) to use 10 examples, or LabeledFewShot(k=10). The value of k sets an upper bound on how many examples will be taken from the training data to insert as prompt demonstrations.\nMethod compile(self, student, *, trainset, sample=True): Optimizes the given student program by attaching labeled examples to it:\n\nstudent – the program to optimize (positional).\ntrainset – required keyword-only list of examples to draw demonstrations from.\nsample – keyword-only bool (default True): if True, it randomly samples min(k, len(trainset)) examples for each predictor in the student; if False, it simply takes the first k examples (in order) from the trainset.\n\nThe compile method returns a new compiled program where each predictor in the student has up to k example demos in its prompt. If the trainset is empty, it returns the student unchanged. This optimizer does not use any “teacher” or iterative improvement – it’s a one-step assignment of labeled data. All arguments after student are keyword-only as indicated by the * in the signature.\n\n\n\nBootstrapFewShot\n\nConstructor BootstrapFewShot.__init__: This optimizer automatically “bootstraps” new prompt demonstrations by having the program attempt the task and collecting successful outputs as examples. Its constructor accepts several parameters, all with defaults:\n\nmetric (callable, default None): A function to judge success on an example (takes e.g. (gold_example, prediction, trace) and returns True/False or a score). If None, any output is considered a success for bootstrapping purposes.\nmetric_threshold (float, default None): A score threshold for the metric – if provided, a prediction must meet or exceed this threshold to count as a successful example. (If metric is boolean-returning, this may not be used.) This parameter allows filtering which outputs become demonstrations.\nteacher_settings (dict, default {}): Settings to configure the behavior of the teacher model (e.g., a different language model or different decoding parameters). These settings (like temperature) will be applied to the teacher when generating outputs.\nmax_bootstrapped_demos (int, default 4): The maximum number of bootstrapped demos (new examples generated from the model itself) to add per predictor.\nmax_labeled_demos (int, default 16): The maximum number of labeled demos (original trainset examples) to use per predictor. This sets an upper bound on using ground-truth examples in addition to bootstrapped ones.\nmax_rounds (int, default 1): How many bootstrapping rounds to perform. Each round can attempt to gather new demos from the model’s outputs.\nmax_errors (int, default 5 in some implementations, or None): The maximum number of errors to tolerate during bootstrapping (e.g., if the student or teacher throws exceptions). If the number of errors exceeds this, the process will halt or raise. In some versions, if set to None, it may fall back on a global setting.\n\nAll these parameters have default values, meaning the constructor can be called with no arguments (it will bootstrap using default settings). They are not declared as keyword-only in the signature (no leading * in the __init__), but in practice they are almost always passed by keyword for clarity.\nMethod compile(self, student, *, teacher=None, trainset, valset=None): This performs the bootstrapping process:\n\nstudent – the program to optimize (positional). The student should initially be “uncompiled” (no demos attached).\nteacher – optional keyword-only. If provided, this is a separate program or model to act as the “coach” producing outputs; if None, the student itself (or a copy) is used as the teacher by default. The teacher is typically a copy of the student (or a version with different settings) that generates candidate outputs.\ntrainset – required keyword-only list of examples for training. The teleprompter will run each example through the teacher (or student) to see if it can get a correct output.\nvalset – optional keyword-only list of examples for validation (default None). If provided, it may be used after bootstrapping to evaluate or select prompts (in the basic BootstrapFewShot, it’s not heavily used; it often defaults to using any remaining train examples not successfully bootstrapped as a validation list).\n\nProcess: The compile method will:\n\nMake a fresh copy of the student (ensuring the original remains unchanged) and also prepare a teacher copy.\nIf max_labeled_demos &gt; 0 and the teacher program isn’t already compiled with demos, it first uses a LabeledFewShot teleprompter to supply up to max_labeled_demos ground-truth examples to the teacher (so the teacher starts with some baseline demos).\nIt then iterates through the trainset, using the teacher to generate predictions. For each example, if the prediction is “successful” according to the metric (or if no metric provided), it will extract the input/output pair from the execution trace and add it as a new demo example (a bootstrapped demo) for the student’s corresponding predictor.\nIt stops once it has collected max_bootstrapped_demos successful demos or has exhausted the training data (or completed max_rounds passes). Any training examples not “bootstrapped” successfully may remain as a validation set.\nFinally, it calls an internal _train() which assembles the final set of demos for each predictor: it takes the bootstrapped demos collected and, if there’s still room (up to max_labeled_demos total), it may fill in some of the original trainset examples as well. The resulting student (with demos attached) is marked as compiled and returned.\n\nAll arguments after student are keyword-only, enforcing calls like teleprompter.compile(student=prog, trainset=data) for clarity. This is consistent with the base Teleprompter signature. The presence of both teacher_settings in the constructor and an optional teacher in compile means you configure how the teacher behaves up front (e.g., use a different model or temperature via settings), and you can also supply a specific teacher program if desired at compile time.\n\n\n\nBootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch\n\nConstructor BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch.__init__: This class builds on BootstrapFewShot to not only bootstrap demos but also perform a random search over multiple candidate prompt sets. It inherits from Teleprompter (and in newer versions, it extends BootstrapFewShot) and introduces additional parameters:\n\nmetric (callable, no default in signature): Similar to BootstrapFewShot, this is the evaluation metric. In this class, metric is effectively required – the absence of a default indicates the user should supply one (the random search needs a way to compare programs). (If not provided, it might default to using the truthy evaluation of outputs if the metric function is None, but typically one provides a metric).\nteacher_settings (dict, default None): Same role as in BootstrapFewShot – configuration for the teacher’s LM behavior. If None, an empty dict is used internally.\nmax_bootstrapped_demos (int, default 4), max_labeled_demos (int, default 16), max_rounds (int, default 1): Same meaning as in BootstrapFewShot (limits on demos and bootstrap iterations).\nnum_candidate_programs (int, default 16): The number of candidate programs (prompt configurations) to evaluate in the random search. This class will generate and test up to this many variations of prompts.\nnum_threads (int, default None): If set, this can be used to parallelize evaluation of candidates (e.g., number of threads for the Evaluate calls). If None, it might default to a global setting or single-threaded evaluation.\nmax_errors (int, default None): Maximum errors tolerated (similar to BootstrapFewShot; if None, use global setting). This applies during each candidate evaluation as well.\nstop_at_score (float, default None): If provided, the search will stop early if it finds a candidate with a metric score greater or equal to this threshold.\nmetric_threshold (float, default None): A threshold applied during the bootstrapping phase for considering a trace successful (similar to BootstrapFewShot’s metric_threshold).\n\nAll these arguments have defaults except metric, and they are typically passed by keyword. In the code, none are forced keyword-only at init, but practically one would use keywords for clarity due to the number of parameters.\nMethod compile(self, student, *, teacher=None, trainset, valset=None, restrict=None, labeled_sample=True): This performs an extended random search on top of bootstrapping:\n\nstudent – the program to optimize (positional).\nteacher – optional keyword-only teacher program (default None) as in BootstrapFewShot.\ntrainset – required keyword-only training examples.\nvalset – optional keyword-only validation set (defaults to using trainset if not provided, as seen in code where self.valset = valset or trainset).\nrestrict – optional keyword-only (default None). This can be used to restrict which candidate indices/seeds to run. Internally, this optimizer uses different random seeds (including some special values like -3, -2, -1 for baseline variants) to generate candidate prompt sets; the restrict parameter can specify a subset of these seeds to actually evaluate (useful for debugging or partial searches).\nlabeled_sample – optional keyword-only bool (default True). This is passed into the LabeledFewShot step for the seed that uses labeled examples only. If True, it randomly samples labeled demos; if False, it takes the first examples (just as in LabeledFewShot’s compile).\n\nProcess: The compile method goes through a sequence of candidate evaluations (using different seed values to shuffle the trainset and vary the demos):\n\nIt considers a set of candidate prompt configurations:\n\nseed = -3: a zero-shot baseline (no demos at all).\nseed = -2: a baseline with labeled examples only (uses LabeledFewShot to attach up to max_labeled_demos demos).\nseed = -1: an “unshuffled” few-shot bootstrap (runs BootstrapFewShot with the trainset in given order).\nseed &gt;= 0: a number of random shuffles. For each seed from 0 up to num_candidate_programs-1, it shuffles a copy of the trainset and picks a random number of bootstrapped demos (between 1 and max_bootstrapped_demos) to gather, then runs BootstrapFewShot with those settings.\n\nFor each candidate, it uses Evaluate to compute the overall metric score on either the valset or training set for that compiled program. It keeps track of the scores.\nIt applies adjustments for any assertion-based failures (specific to DSPy, e.g., if the program has internal assertion checks) – see the section subtracting for _suggest_failures and zeroing out if _assert_failures.\nIt identifies the best-scoring program and can stop early if stop_at_score was specified and achieved.\nFinally, it attaches a list of all candidate programs and their scores to the best program (best_program.candidate_programs) for reference, and returns the best program.\n\nAll parameters after student are keyword-only, aligning with the interface of BootstrapFewShot (trainset must be named, etc.). This optimizer’s interface is more complex, but the use of keyword-only helps avoid confusion when calling compile with many optional settings. One idiosyncrasy: the compile method itself uses the internal BootstrapFewShot class for seeds -1 and &gt;=0, thereby inheriting any parameters set in the constructor like metric_threshold or teacher_settings and reusing them for each candidate search.\n\n\n\nEnsemble\n\nConstructor Ensemble.__init__(self, *, reduce_fn=None, size=None, deterministic=False): The Ensemble teleprompter does not deal with datasets or metrics at all – instead, it creates an ensemble from multiple programs. All its parameters are keyword-only (notice the leading *, in the signature):\n\nreduce_fn (callable, default None): A function that takes a list of outputs (one from each program in the ensemble) and reduces them to a single output. For example, DSPy provides dspy.majority to pick the most common answer, which is a typical choice for classification tasks. If reduce_fn is None, the ensemble’s forward will return the list of all outputs.\nsize (int, default None): If set, the ensemble will randomly select size programs out of the provided list each time it is called, rather than using all programs. If None, it uses all programs each time.\ndeterministic (bool, default False): If True, the ensemble would aim to produce deterministic behavior (e.g., always pick the same subset for a given input). Currently, this is not implemented (the code asserts that deterministic is False).\n\nThese parameters allow controlling how the ensemble combines multiple models’ outputs. All must be passed by keyword, e.g., Ensemble(reduce_fn=dspy.majority, size=5).\nMethod compile(self, programs): Instead of optimizing prompts, this teleprompter combines programs. The programs argument is a list of DSPy programs to ensemble, passed as a single positional argument. There are no trainset or metric arguments. The method returns a new EnsembledProgram (constructed internally) which, when called, will:\n\nIf size is specified, randomly sample that many programs from the list; otherwise use all programs.\nInvoke each selected program’s __call__ (or forward) on the given inputs.\nCollect their outputs, and then either apply the reduce_fn if provided or return the list of outputs as-is.\n\nThe compile here is straightforward: it doesn’t “learn” or modify the programs, just wraps them. Notably, there is no keyword-only enforcement in this signature, because it only takes one argument (programs). The usage is simply ensemble_teleprompter.compile([prog1, prog2, ...]). This class is an outlier in that it doesn’t use any of the training data or metric infrastructure – it’s purely a structural optimizer.\n\n\n\nFinetuneTeleprompter (Base Class for Fine-tuning)\n\nConstructor FinetuneTeleprompter.__init__(self, train_kwargs=None): This base class is designed for optimizers that fine-tune language model weights. It introduces a single configuration parameter:\n\ntrain_kwargs (dict or dict-of-dicts, default None): Training arguments for fine-tuning. It can be one dictionary applied to all LMs, or a mapping from specific LM objects to their respective parameter dicts. For example, this might include learning rate, number of epochs, etc. If None, it defaults to an empty configuration. Internally, the constructor converts this into a standard form (using convert_to_lm_dict) where each LM maps to its own settings (even if the same settings are used for all).\n\nThis class does not take a metric in its constructor – because often fine-tuning might use the training loss as implicit metric, or the metric can be applied on a validation set externally. It primarily encapsulates how to call the underlying LM’s fine-tune method. FinetuneTeleprompter doesn’t implement a new compile itself – it relies on child classes to implement the strategy. After construction, it holds a train_kwargs mapping that will be used during fine-tune calls.\nNo direct compile method: FinetuneTeleprompter inherits the abstract compile from Teleprompter but does not override it, so it can’t be used on its own. Subclasses (like BootstrapFinetune) will implement the actual compile logic. Essentially, FinetuneTeleprompter serves to store training configurations and provide utility methods (in the DSPy code, e.g., finetune_lms static method in the newer implementation, or convert_to_lm_dict). Think of it as an abstract base similar to Teleprompter, but specifically for fine-tuning optimizers, ensuring they handle train_kwargs uniformly.\n\n\n\nBootstrapFinetune\n\nConstructor BootstrapFinetune.__init__: This class combines bootstrapping with actual fine-tuning of an LM. It inherits from FinetuneTeleprompter. Its parameters are as follows:\n\nmetric (callable, default None): An optional metric function to evaluate model outputs (similar to other teleprompters). If provided, it can be used to judge which outputs are “successful” when bootstrapping data or to guide the selection of fine-tuning data. If None, all outputs might be considered or a default (like always True) is used.\nmultitask (bool, default True): Whether to fine-tune on all tasks/predictors jointly (True) or separately (False). If multitask=True, all data from all predictors might be combined to fine-tune a single model (or one model per unique LM); if False, it will fine-tune separate models for each predictor (the code sets data indices accordingly).\ntrain_kwargs (dict or dict-of-LM dicts, default None): Passed to the base FinetuneTeleprompter to configure fine-tuning (learning rate, epochs, etc.). If a plain dict is given, the same settings apply to all language models; a more granular mapping can specify different hyperparameters per LM.\nadapter (Adapter or dict of LMs to Adapter, default None): An optional specification of an adapter to use for fine-tuning (e.g., for parameter-efficient fine-tuning). If provided, this indicates which fine-tuning method or adapter to use for each LM. Internally converted to a dict mapping each LM to an Adapter (using a similar technique to train_kwargs).\nexclude_demos (bool, default False): If True, after fine-tuning it will clear out any prompt demonstrations in the predictors (perhaps under the assumption that the model has learned from them and they are no longer needed). If False, it leaves any demos in place. In the code, after fine-tuning, they actually set pred.demos = [] if exclude_demos is True.\nnum_threads (int, default None): Number of threads for parallel fine-tuning jobs. If you have multiple predictors to fine-tune (e.g., multitask=False scenario or multiple LMs in a program), this sets how many can run in parallel. It defaults to None, which means use the global default (or 1 if not set).\n\nAll these parameters have defaults, so you can call BootstrapFinetune() with none, and it will use a multitask approach with whatever global LM is configured. The signature does not enforce keyword-only, but given the number of parameters, using keywords is strongly recommended for clarity (e.g., BootstrapFinetune(metric=my_metric, epochs=2) etc., though epochs would actually go inside train_kwargs in this design).\nMethod compile(self, student, trainset, teacher=None, valset=None, target=\"t5-large\", bsize=12, accumsteps=1, lr=5e-5, epochs=1, bf16=False, int8=False, peft=False, path_prefix=None): This is a two-phase optimizer: it first bootstraps prompt examples, then fine-tunes the model on those examples. Its signature is notably different in that it does not strictly require trainset to be passed as a keyword (there is no * before trainset in the current implementation’s signature, meaning student and trainset could be given positionally). However, to avoid confusion, it’s often called with keywords for clarity. The parameters are:\n\nstudent – the program to optimize (positional).\ntrainset – the list of examples to train on (positional or keyword). These will be used both for bootstrapping prompts and as the fine-tuning dataset.\nteacher – optional (default None). A teacher program or list of programs. If provided, those will be used to bootstrap examples; if None, it will issue a warning that it’s using an uncompiled student as teacher. Often, one might pass a copy of the student or a differently configured model as the teacher for the bootstrap step.\nvalset – optional validation set (default None). Not extensively used inside the compile method for Bootstrapping (the code primarily uses trainset for bootstrapping and doesn’t explicitly use valset in fine-tuning, though it could be used to evaluate during training or after).\nFine-tuning hyperparameters: These are all optional with defaults, and they mirror typical HuggingFace/transformers fine-tuning settings:\n\ntarget (str, default \"t5-large\"): The model name or identifier to fine-tune. This class may instantiate a fresh model of this type for fine-tuning or use it as an identifier to save the fine-tuned weights.\nbsize (int, default 12): Batch size for fine-tuning.\naccumsteps (int, default 1): Gradient accumulation steps.\nlr (float, default 5e-5): Learning rate for fine-tuning.\nepochs (int, default 1): Number of fine-tuning epochs.\nbf16 (bool, default False): Whether to use bfloat16 precision.\nint8 (bool, default False): Whether to use int8 quantization for fine-tuning (likely requires an adapter that supports it).\npeft (bool, default False): Whether to use a PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine Tuning) method (like LoRA). If True, the fine-tuning will use an adapter method rather than full model tuning.\npath_prefix (str, default None): An optional prefix path for saving fine-tuned model checkpoints. If provided, the fine-tuned model weights are saved under this path with a generated name.\n\n\nThe compile process is as follows:\n\nBootstrap Phase: It uses an internal self.teleprompter, which is a BootstrapFewShot instance configured in __init__ (with max_bootstrapped_demos very high and max_labeled_demos=0 by default in some implementations), to compile the student (or teacher) with bootstrapped demonstrations. Essentially, it generates a set of demonstrations by running the teacher (or student) on the trainset and collecting successful outputs (using the given metric if provided). This yields a compiled program with demos.\nIt then prepares fine-tuning data: for each predictor in the compiled program, it takes all the demos (input-output pairs) and formats them into prompt-completion training examples appropriate for the language model fine-tuning. The code constructs prompt text and target text from each demo using the predictor’s signature/template, accumulating them in a list.\nIt shuffles the fine-tuning data and writes it to disk as a .jsonl file (or multiple files if multitask vs per-predictor).\nFine-tuning Phase: It invokes a fine-tuning routine (likely finetune_hf for HuggingFace models) on the prepared data for the specified target model, with the given hyperparameters (batch_size, epochs, lr, etc.). This produces fine-tuned model checkpoint(s).\nIt loads these fine-tuned weights into the student’s predictors – replacing their lm with the fine-tuned model(s). If multitask=True, typically one model is fine-tuned for all (assuming a shared LM); if False, each predictor might get its own fine-tuned model. The code ensures the structure matches and assigns the new LMs.\nIf exclude_demos=True, it clears the demos for each predictor (since the model is now supposed to handle the task without needing prompt examples).\nThe method marks the program as compiled and returns the fine-tuned compiled program.\n\nKey points: The trainset here is used both to bootstrap examples and to generate the fine-tuning dataset, effectively turning successful model outputs into training data (this is a form of self-training). The presence of both metric-based bootstrapping and actual gradient descent is unique to this optimizer. The interface inconsistency is that trainset is not forced to keyword-only (likely an oversight), whereas most others require naming it. Best practice is to call it as teleprompter.compile(student, trainset=..., teacher=..., epochs=..., lr=..., ...) for clarity. All the fine-tuning hyperparameters are keyword-only by position (they come after the required args and * in the function definition), meaning in code you must call them as named arguments (which is natural for these settings).\n\n\n\nCOPRO (Co-Prompt Optimizer)\n\nConstructor COPRO.__init__: COPRO aims to optimize the instructions in a prompt by iterative generation and testing. Its parameters:\n\nprompt_model (LM client, default None): The language model used to propose new instructions. If None, the system likely defaults to the same model as the student (or whatever is set in global settings). By providing a separate prompt_model, you could use a larger or more creative model to generate prompt variants while using a different task_model (the student) for execution.\nmetric (callable, default None): The metric to evaluate the student’s performance. If None, COPRO can still run, but it might not have a quantitative way to compare prompts – in practice, a metric should be supplied so it can choose the best prompt.\nbreadth (int, default 10): The number of new prompt candidates to generate at each iteration (each “depth”). Essentially, in each round COPRO will produce this many alternative instructions via the prompt_model.\ndepth (int, default 3): The number of iterations (rounds of prompt generation and evaluation) to perform. A depth of 3 means it will generate new instructions 3 times, each time possibly building on or replacing previous ones.\ninit_temperature (float, default 1.4): The temperature setting for the prompt generation model in the initial generation round (higher temperature means more randomness/creativity). This influences the diversity of prompts generated. In the code, this temperature might be used for prompt_model when sampling instructions.\ntrack_stats (bool, default False): Whether to collect statistics about the optimization process. If True, COPRO will record details such as the distribution of scores for prompts at each iteration (min, max, avg, std of top prompts, etc.). These stats would be stored in attributes like results_best, results_latest, etc., on the returned program for analysis.\n\nAll of these parameters are keyword-only by design (note the *, in the __init__ signature in code) – meaning you must call, for example, COPRO(metric=..., breadth=20). This enforces clarity given the number of optional arguments.\nMethod compile(self, student, *, trainset, eval_kwargs): COPRO’s compile differs from previous ones in that it doesn’t attach demos or fine-tune weights, but instead alters the prompt instructions of the student’s predictors. Parameters:\n\nstudent – the program to optimize (positional). This program likely contains one or more predictors with an instruction (prompt template) that we want to improve.\ntrainset – required keyword-only list of examples. These will be used to evaluate the quality of instructions. Essentially, for each candidate prompt, COPRO will run the student on the trainset and measure performance.\neval_kwargs – required keyword-only dict of arguments for evaluation. This is passed to DSPy’s Evaluate to evaluate the student on the trainset. For example, eval_kwargs might specify num_threads for parallel evaluation or display_progress flags. It’s mandatory to provide (the code does not have a default), ensuring the user is explicit about how to evaluate (e.g., eval_kwargs={\"display_progress\": False} or with specific settings).\n\nProcess: In simplified terms, COPRO will:\n\nMake a deepcopy of the student to work on (so as not to modify the original mid-process).\nEvaluate the initial student on the trainset to get a baseline score (not explicitly shown in snippet, but likely done implicitly as part of loop or for stats tracking).\nFor each iteration (up to depth):\n\nUse the prompt_model to generate breadth new candidate instructions for each predictor. The generation likely uses one of two Signature classes defined in the code:\n\nBasicGenerateInstruction if it’s the first round (which just takes the original instruction and asks for an improved one).\nGenerateInstructionGivenAttempts if it’s after the first round (which provides some of the previously tried instructions and their scores to the prompt model, so it can propose a better one).\n\nFor each predictor in the student program, replace its instruction with each of the candidate instructions one at a time and evaluate the program on the trainset using the metric (via Evaluate with eval_kwargs).\nTrack the performance of each candidate. If track_stats is True, record the stats of these candidates (min, max, etc.).\nPossibly filter out duplicate or very similar instructions (the code has _drop_duplicates to eliminate repeated candidates that yield the same results).\nSelect the top-performing instruction(s) to carry forward. Likely it keeps the best one as the new base instruction (and possibly uses others for context in subsequent rounds).\n\nRepeat for the specified number of depths. By the end, ideally, the student’s predictors have improved instructions that yield better metric performance on the trainset.\nReturn the optimized program (with its instruction updated to the best found). If track_stats was True, the returned program might have attributes like results_best and results_latest containing the recorded statistics.\n\nAll parameters after student are keyword-only, so one would call teleprompter.compile(student=prog, trainset=data, eval_kwargs=eval_args). The absence of a teacher parameter here is notable – COPRO doesn’t use a separate teacher model to generate outputs for evaluation; instead, it uses a separate prompt_model to generate prompts (instructions), and the original program (or its LM, possibly configured via teacher_settings if any) to evaluate those prompts. Essentially, COPRO is searching in prompt/instruction space, guided by metric evaluations on the trainset.\n\n\n\nMIPROv2\n\nConstructor MIPROv2.__init__: MIPRO (“Mixed Initiative Prompt Optimization”, perhaps) is one of the most complex teleprompters, combining few-shot bootstrapping, instruction proposal, and hyperparameter search. Its initialization has many parameters, mostly optional, to cover various aspects of the search:\n\nmetric (callable, required): The evaluation metric to maximize. Unlike many others, MIPROv2 does not default metric to None – you must provide a metric function. This makes sense given the complexity: it needs a quantitative measure to drive the optimization.\nprompt_model (LM, default None): Similar to COPRO, an optional separate model used to propose instructions or other prompt components. If None, defaults to the globally configured LM (or the student’s LM).\ntask_model (LM, default None): If the student program uses a particular LM, task_model can override or specify it. If None, it uses dspy.settings.lm (the globally configured default LM) as the model to actually run the task. Essentially, task_model is the model that executes the prompts (the “student’s LM”), and prompt_model is the model that generates new prompt candidates; they could be different.\nteacher_settings (dict, default None): Similar to earlier teleprompters, this can hold settings for any teacher or evaluation model usage. MIPRO does some bootstrapping internally, so this could configure how that’s done. Internally, if None, it stores as an empty {}.\nmax_bootstrapped_demos (int, default 4): The initial number of bootstrapped few-shot examples to gather (per predictor) for use in prompts.\nmax_labeled_demos (int, default 4): The initial number of labeled (ground-truth) examples to include per predictor. (Notice this default is 4, smaller than the 16 used in simpler teleprompters, possibly to limit scope for the automated search).\nauto (Literal “light”/“medium”/“heavy” or None, default “light”): This is a high-level switch to configure how exhaustive the search should be. If set to “medium” or “heavy”, the teleprompter will automatically set or override other parameters (like number of trials, etc.) to spend more effort. If auto=None, the user must manually specify certain parameters (like num_trials). The allowed values are enforced; any other string would raise an error.\nnum_candidates (int, default None): The number of candidate solutions (e.g., prompt combinations) to consider in the search. If auto is None, this must be provided (along with num_trials) or an error is raised. If auto is set, num_candidates should not be provided (it would be overridden by the auto settings).\nnum_threads (int, default None): Number of threads for parallel operations (like evaluation). If None, falls back to global setting.\nmax_errors (int, default None): Max errors to tolerate; if None, use global setting (similar usage as before).\nseed (int, default 9): Random seed for reproducibility. Used for shuffling and any stochastic decisions.\ninit_temperature (float, default 0.5): Initial temperature for any prompt generation or sampling (lower than COPRO’s default, implying more conservative generation).\nverbose (bool, default False): If True, provides more logging info during the process.\ntrack_stats (bool, default True): Whether to collect and store statistics of the optimization (like how COPRO does). By default True, so it will track performance of trials, etc.\nlog_dir (str, default None): If provided, the directory path to save logs or intermediate results (like candidate programs, evaluations).\nmetric_threshold (float, default None): Similar to earlier, a threshold for the metric to perhaps prune or consider a trial successful. If set, any candidate with metric below this might be discarded or considered failing.\n\nThe constructor sets a lot of these into internal attributes and does some validation: e.g., ensures if auto is not None, the user hasn’t also set num_candidates or num_trials (to avoid conflict), and if auto is None, then both num_candidates and num_trials must be specified by the user. It also immediately converts teacher_settings to an empty dict if None and assigns default models if prompt_model or task_model are None. All parameters except metric have defaults, but given their number, they are meant to be given by keyword (the signature includes no * here, but practically one would hardly pass 15 args positionally in order). The ordering places metric first (required), then the two models, then other settings.\nMethod compile(self, student, *, trainset, teacher=None, valset=None, num_trials=None, max_bootstrapped_demos=None, max_labeled_demos=None, seed=None, minibatch=True, minibatch_size=35, minibatch_full_eval_steps=5, program_aware_proposer=True, data_aware_proposer=True, view_data_batch_size=10, tip_aware_proposer=True, fewshot_aware_proposer=True, requires_permission_to_run=True, provide_traceback=None): This signature is expansive, but all arguments after student are keyword-only (enforced by the *). Here’s what they mean:\n\nstudent – the program to optimize (positional).\ntrainset – required keyword-only list of examples to train/optimize on.\nteacher – optional keyword-only (default None). If provided, used during the bootstrap of few-shot examples (similar to BootstrapFewShot’s teacher). If None, the student (or rather its task_model) is used to bootstrap itself.\nvalset – optional keyword-only list of examples for validation (default None). MIPRO uses a validation set to evaluate candidate prompts (distinct from trainset if provided) and for final evaluation of each trial. If not provided, it may split the trainset or use part of it for validation implicitly.\nnum_trials – optional keyword-only (int). The number of search trials to run. If auto is None, this must be set (and should correspond roughly to num_candidates and the effort desired). If auto is “light”/“medium”/“heavy,num_trials` will be determined internally (and providing it will raise an error).\nmax_bootstrapped_demos, max_labeled_demos – optional ints to override the defaults for this compile run. If provided, they will update the internal max_bootstrapped_demos/max_labeled_demos before running. Otherwise, it uses the values from the constructor (which might have been set via auto mode).\nseed – optional int to override the random seed for this run (if not provided, uses the seed from init). This allows one to repeat the search with different seeds or ensure reproducibility.\nminibatch (bool, default True): Whether to use minibatch evaluation when scoring prompts. If True, and the validation set is large, MIPRO will evaluate in batches rather than all at once (to speed up or simulate iterative evaluation). If False, it evaluates on the full valset every time.\nminibatch_size (int, default 35): The number of examples to use in each minibatch evaluation if minibatch is True. It will evaluate candidate programs on chunks of this many examples and possibly use an average or intermediate pruning strategy.\nminibatch_full_eval_steps (int, default 5): If using minibatch mode, this could indicate how frequently (in terms of trial count or iterations) a full evaluation on the entire valset is done, or how many minibatch steps constitute a “full” eval for logging. (This parameter’s use is a bit advanced; it might define after how many partial batches to do a full evaluation or something similar.)\nThe next several are boolean flags controlling proposers – these determine what aspects of the prompt the algorithm is allowed to propose changes for:\n\nprogram_aware_proposer (default True): If True, the optimizer will propose modifications aware of the program’s structure (likely meaning it can consider changes to instructions in context of entire program).\ndata_aware_proposer (default True): If True, proposals might take into account the data distribution or particularities of examples (perhaps by examining some examples during instruction proposals).\nview_data_batch_size (int, default 10): Possibly the number of examples the proposers can look at at once when generating suggestions (if data-aware).\ntip_aware_proposer (default True): “Tip” could refer to a part of prompt (like a prefix or a suffix). If True, the proposer can adjust the “tip” (maybe the output field prefix or few-shot separators).\nfewshot_aware_proposer (default True): If True, the proposer can adjust few-shot examples or how they’re used (since MIPRO also handles bootstrapped demos).\n\nrequires_permission_to_run (bool, default True): If True, the compile will prompt the user for confirmation before running a potentially expensive search (especially in heavy mode). If set to False, it will run to completion without interactive confirmation.\nprovide_traceback (bool or None, default None): If True, any errors encountered might include tracebacks in the logs; if False, suppress tracebacks; if None, use a default setting (perhaps false). This is mainly for debugging if something goes wrong during evaluation, which can be helpful when verbose logging.\n\nProcess: MIPROv2’s compile is very comprehensive. Summarizing:\n\nFew-shot Bootstrapping: It likely begins by ensuring the student has some initial demos. There is a call demo_candidates = self._bootstrap_fewshot_examples(program, trainset, seed, teacher) which presumably uses max_bootstrapped_demos and max_labeled_demos to produce a set of demonstration candidates (similar to BootstrapFewShot but perhaps generating multiple sets).\nInstruction Proposal: Then it calls _propose_instructions(...) which uses the prompt_model to propose new instructions, possibly taking into account the current program, the data, and the demo candidates. The parameters like view_data_batch_size, program_aware_proposer, etc., influence this step – e.g., it might generate instructions while seeing a batch of view_data_batch_size examples or not.\nIf zero-shot optimization is indicated (no demos allowed, zeroshot_opt), it may discard demos to focus purely on instructions.\nPrompt Parameter Optimization: It then calls _optimize_prompt_parameters(...) – this likely orchestrates the main search over trials (num_trials). In each trial, it might:\n\nChoose a set of demos (from demo_candidates, possibly none if zero-shot) and an instruction (from instruction_candidates proposed) to form a candidate program (a specific configuration of prompts).\nEvaluate that program on the valset using the metric (the code uses an Evaluate instance for the valset with the given metric and threads).\nUse something like Optuna (since the code imports optuna if available) to intelligently choose the next combination of parameters to try (the “Bayesian” or guided search aspect).\nPossibly prune low-performing trials early (since the code has integration for pruning via intermediate minibatch evaluation).\nRepeat until num_trials are done or the search converges.\n\nIt likely uses the auto setting to determine num_trials and possibly adjust minibatch usage. For example, “heavy” auto might set a large number of trials and larger validation set size.\nIf requires_permission_to_run=True, before starting the full search, it will print an estimate of how many LM calls or how long it might take and prompt the user to continue. If the user declines, it aborts and returns the original student unchanged.\nThroughout, it tracks the best program found. At the end, it returns the optimized program (with improved instructions and possibly with selected demos attached). It also attaches logs like trial_logs containing the score of each trial and the parameters used, as well as possibly storing in student._compiled = True.\n\nThe key feature of MIPROv2 is that it integrates multiple dimensions: it can optimize the instruction text (like COPRO), the selection of few-shot examples (like BootstrapFewShot), and even other prompt parameters (e.g., it might experiment with presence or absence of demos – that’s why it has both fewshot_aware_proposer and code logic for zero-shot vs few-shot). It effectively generalizes and combines ideas from the simpler teleprompters. Because of this, its interface is the most complex. All those boolean flags allow turning on/off certain aspects of the search:\n\ne.g., one could run it with program_aware_proposer=False to ignore program structure differences when proposing instructions, or minibatch=False to always evaluate on full validation set (safer but slower).\n\nAs with other teleprompters, trainset and other main parameters are keyword-only to prevent mix-ups. The compile method is clearly intended to be called with named arguments for anything beyond the basics (e.g., teleprompter.compile(student=prog, trainset=data, valset=dev, num_trials=50, fewshot_aware_proposer=False, requires_permission_to_run=False)). The consistency in using keyword-only here is welcome given how many tuning knobs exist."

    "section": "Patterns and Idiosyncrasies",
    "text": "Patterns and Idiosyncrasies\nExamining all these optimizers, we can observe several patterns in how parameters are structured, as well as some inconsistencies or outliers:\n\nCommon Structure – “compile” with trainset: Almost every optimizer uses a compile(student, *, ... trainset ..., ...) method to perform the optimization on a given program and dataset. Requiring trainset as a keyword-only argument is a common design (seen in Teleprompter base, LabeledFewShot, BootstrapFewShot, RandomSearch, COPRO, MIPRO). This pattern enforces clarity that a training set must be provided and avoids accidental swapping of positional arguments. An inconsistency here is BootstrapFinetune, whose compile signature does not enforce keyword-only for trainset (it takes student, trainset positionally). This makes BootstrapFinetune stand out as allowing compile(prog, data) without naming trainset, whereas others would require compile(prog, trainset=data). It’s likely an oversight in that implementation because the conceptual pattern is that trainset should be keyword-only for all.\nPositional vs Keyword-only in Constructors: The base classes (Teleprompter, FinetuneTeleprompter) and some simple ones have very few parameters and thus no need for keyword-only in __init__. E.g., Teleprompter and FinetuneTeleprompter have none or one parameter and don’t use *. But Ensemble explicitly uses * to force its three parameters (reduce_fn, size, deterministic) to be keyword-only in the constructor. This is a design choice to improve readability: calling Ensemble(size=3, reduce_fn=majority) is self-documenting, versus relying on positional order. Other optimizers like BootstrapFewShot, BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch, BootstrapFinetune, COPRO, MIPROv2 did not enforce * in their __init__, despite having many parameters. This means in theory one could call BootstrapFewShot(None, {}, 4, 16, 1) positionally, but that would be very unclear. In practice, users likely call BootstrapFewShot(metric=my_metric, max_rounds=2, ...). The lack of uniform use of keyword-only in constructors is an inconsistency. A pattern is that newer or more user-facing classes (Ensemble, perhaps MIPRO if it was considered user-facing) lean towards keyword-only for clarity, whereas older classes did not enforce it.\nParameter Naming Conventions:\n\nMost classes use trainset and (optionally) valset consistently to refer to data. This is uniform across optimizers.\nThe use of teacher vs teacher_settings is a bit confusing across classes:\n\nBootstrapFewShot and RandomSearch have a teacher_settings in the constructor (for LM config) and a teacher argument in compile (for an actual program instance).\nBootstrapFinetune similarly takes an adapter (similar concept to teacher settings, but specific to fine-tuning) in constructor and a teacher in compile.\nMIPROv2 uses teacher_settings in constructor (to adjust the teacher LM) and teacher in compile.\nLabeledFewShot and Ensemble do not involve a teacher at all.\nCOPRO does not have a teacher parameter either; instead it has prompt_model and uses the student’s own execution for evaluation. Inconsistency arises in naming: e.g., BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch reuses teacher_settings from its parent and has teacher in compile, whereas FinetuneTeleprompter/BootstrapFinetune introduced a separate concept of adapter and train_kwargs for fine-tuning. These serve a similar role (configuring how the “teaching” or training is done) but under different names. Also, in MIPROv2, there is both teacher_settings and a teacher argument, plus separate prompt_model and task_model. This can be conceptually hard to follow:\n\nteacher generally means an alternate DSPy program or LM used to generate outputs for bootstrapping.\nteacher_settings means a dictionary of parameters to apply to whichever model is acting as teacher (like setting its temperature or max tokens).\nprompt_model is an LM used for generating new prompt text (distinct from the task).\nadapter in finetuning is an object encapsulating how to fine-tune (distinct from anything in non-finetune classes). Ideally, the interface could be cleaner if, for example, every Teleprompter had a teacher argument in compile (for a program or LM) and possibly a unified way to specify how that teacher should behave (maybe always via teacher_settings). Currently it’s partly unified (teacher + teacher_settings) in bootstrap classes, but fine-tune adds adapter, and COPRO/MIPRO add prompt_model separately. This is an area of inconsistency in naming and usage.\n\n\nMetric and Threshold: Every optimizer that evaluates outputs uses a metric parameter name for the evaluation function. This is consistent. Some optimizers (BootstrapFewShot, RandomSearch, MIPRO) also use metric_threshold as an optional cutoff for success. The concept of metric_threshold is not present in others like Finetune or COPRO (COPRO could theoretically use it but doesn’t expose it; Finetune focuses on loss). The inconsistent part is documentation vs implementation: e.g., the official docs for BootstrapFewShot did not list metric_threshold or max_errors, yet the code and random search clearly use them. This indicates either a new feature that wasn’t documented or a parameter considered more internal. As a pattern, many classes allow a None metric to mean “no filtering, just optimize blindly” and some threshold to refine what “success” means.\nDemo-related parameters: We see repeated parameters controlling number of examples:\n\nk in LabeledFewShot.\nmax_bootstrapped_demos and max_labeled_demos in BootstrapFewShot, RandomSearch, MIPRO. These generally default to some small numbers (4 and 16, or 4 and 4 in MIPRO). The choice of 4/16 vs 4/4 is inconsistent. Possibly, earlier versions assumed up to 16 labeled demos is fine (for simpler tasks or lots of data), whereas MIPRO’s authors might have found using 16 made the search space too large or wasn’t needed, and so they reduced both defaults to 4. It’s an inconsistency in default tuning: two classes aimed at similar goals have different default for max labeled demos (16 vs 4). Similarly, LabeledFewShot and BootstrapFewShot share the 16 default for labeled demos (and LabeledFewShot’s sole param k=16 aligns with BootstrapFewShot’s 16), whereas MIPRO diverges.\n\nParallelism parameters: num_threads appears in BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch, BootstrapFinetune, MIPRO, but not in plain BootstrapFewShot or LabeledFewShot. The base Evaluate class in DSPy likely uses a global thread count if not specified. The newer/complex optimizers expose num_threads to give the user control over parallel evaluations. This is a pattern of evolving design: earlier optimizers didn’t surface this (assuming either single-thread or using global config), later ones made it explicit. So there’s inconsistency across classes – e.g., one can’t directly set threads in BootstrapFewShot without going through dspy.settings, but one can in RandomSearch via the teleprompter’s param.\nBoolean flags for features: Some advanced optimizers (MIPRO) have many boolean flags to toggle sub-behaviors (program_aware_proposer, etc.), whereas simpler ones bake in one strategy. This reflects differing complexity: simpler optimizers don’t have these flags at all. It’s expected, but it means the interface isn’t uniform – MIPRO stands out with a very large signature and lots of optional toggles, compared to something like BootstrapFewShot which has a concise interface. From a consistency standpoint, MIPRO’s interface might be overwhelming relative to others.\n\nUse of * in method signatures: As noted, almost all compile methods use * to separate student (positional) from the rest (keyword-only). This is a clear pattern for compile. The only exceptions:\n\nBootstrapFinetune’s compile, which did not put a * before teacher and trainset in the older implementation. (Documentation suggests there might be a version that does, but the code we saw treats teacher as positional after student, which is unusual).\nEnsemble.compile doesn’t use * simply because it has a single argument. This pattern – having the dataset and other settings be keyword-only – is generally followed and is good for clarity. The inconsistency in BootstrapFinetune is likely something to correct for uniformity.\n\nPublic Method Names (step vs compile): All these optimizers use a method named compile as the entry point to perform optimization, rather than something like step() or optimize(). The user question mentioned “methods such as step or optimize,” but in DSPy’s design it appears compile is the standard name (compiling a program with a teleprompter means optimizing it). None of the classes have a public method literally named step or optimize – they all stick to compile(). Internally, some have helper methods (_bootstrap_one_example, _train, etc.) but those are private. So there is consistency in using compile as the interface method, inherited from Teleprompter. The only slight oddity is Ensemble using compile in a non-learning sense, but still logically “compiling an ensemble program.”\nOutlier Classes:\n\nEnsemble is quite different in purpose (no metric, no trainset). It still fits the Teleprompter interface (taking programs and returning a program), but its parameter set (reduce_fn, deterministic, etc.) doesn’t overlap with others. It’s an idiosyncratic case included in the same module for convenience.\nFinetuneTeleprompter as a base class is a bit of an abstraction layer not exposed to end-users typically. It doesn’t quite act on its own. This is an internal consistency: Teleprompter vs FinetuneTeleprompter both serving as abstract bases for two families (prompt-based vs fine-tune-based optimizers). They share the interface but introduce different init params (none vs train_kwargs). A slight inconsistency is that Teleprompter base has no init params, FinetuneTeleprompter does – but that’s due to the nature of fine-tuning needing configuration up front.\nCOPRO and MIPRO introduce parameter names not seen elsewhere (e.g., breadth, depth, auto, all the proposer flags). They were likely developed later to tackle prompt optimization more holistically. They still follow patterns like requiring trainset and using metric, but add their own twist. COPRO, for instance, doesn’t accept teacher or use max_rounds – instead it has depth for iterations of prompt proposals, essentially analogous but specific to its domain. MIPRO aggregates parameters from many others, making it quite an outlier in complexity.\n\nDefaults and Range of Values: Many numeric defaults seem somewhat ad-hoc but within a small range:\n\n4 and 16 appear frequently (suggesting maybe at most 4 bootstrapped examples or 16 labeled examples as a reasonable default).\nMax rounds default to 1 in bootstrap (a single iteration is often enough to get some improvement).\nRandomSearch defaults to 16 candidate programs (which aligns with maybe trying seeds -3, -2, -1 and 0..12 – indeed in code they loop range(-3, num_candidate_sets) which for 16 gives seeds -3..15 inclusive, that’s 19, but likely they intended a fixed count; perhaps the special negatives are not counted in that num).\nFinetuning hyperparams default to typical values like 1 epoch, batch 12, lr 5e-5 – those mirror common practice in ML.\nThe auto=\"light\" default in MIPRO suggests they wanted the safer, quicker configuration by default.\n\nThe inconsistencies here are minor – just that some defaults might not align (e.g., if one expected MIPRO to default to the same 16 labeled demos as simpler teleprompters, they’d be surprised it’s 4). Another example: LabeledFewShot vs BootstrapFewShot default k=16 vs max_labeled_demos=16 (consistent), but Bootstrapped demos default 4 vs Labeled default 16 in simple version, whereas MIPRO uses 4 for both – possibly to balance that it will do iterative improvements.\nError handling and user interaction parameters: Some newer classes have parameters related to robustness:\n\nmax_errors is present in BootstrapFewShot and RandomSearch (to avoid infinite loops or crashes if too many errors occur). Others like Finetune don’t expose max_errors (though Evaluate inside might use a global max error).\nMIPRO uses requires_permission_to_run to ensure the user is aware of resource cost; no other class does something like that (likely because MIPRO can be very expensive). This is a unique design consideration for an outlier.\nprovide_traceback is similarly only in MIPRO, aimed at debugging – indicating MIPRO expects potentially long runs where silent failures would be frustrating.\nEnsemble asserts if deterministic=True because it’s not implemented, which is a bit user-unfriendly (they could have just not offered the parameter or documented that it’s a future feature). This is an idiosyncrasy in Ensemble’s interface (exposing a param that only throws an error if set True).\n\n\nIn summary, patterns include the consistent use of a compile method with student + keyword-only datasets/metrics, the presence of metric functions in most, and repeated use of parameters controlling how many examples to use or generate. Idiosyncrasies and inconsistencies include differences in keyword-only enforcement, slight naming mismatches (teacher_settings vs adapter vs separate model params), differences in default values for similar concepts, and the sheer divergence in complexity between simpler teleprompters (LabeledFewShot, BootstrapFewShot) and the complex ones (MIPRO, COPRO).\nEach optimizer class was likely developed to extend functionality, which led to some divergence in interface. For example, COPRO and MIPRO added new kinds of parameters (depth, breadth, auto, etc.) that don’t appear in earlier classes, making the overall module less uniform."

    "section": "Recommendations for Unifying the Interface",
    "text": "Recommendations for Unifying the Interface\nTo improve consistency and usability across these teleprompter optimizers, we suggest the following changes:\n\nEnforce Keyword-Only for Key Parameters: Ensure that in all optimizers, important parameters like trainset, teacher, and other configuration options are keyword-only. This means adding *, where missing (e.g., in BootstrapFinetune.compile to require naming trainset and teacher, and in any constructor where positional use could be confusing). A uniform rule could be: any optimizer method that takes a dataset or multiple optional settings should use keyword-only args beyond the program argument. This will prevent mistakes and make code more self-documenting.\nStandardize Teacher Configuration: Unify the approach to teacher models across classes:\n\nAlways use a teacher argument in compile for providing an alternate program or LM for generating outputs (as is done in BootstrapFewShot, etc.), and consistently use a teacher_settings (or similarly named) parameter in the constructor to configure that teacher’s behavior. For fine-tuning, instead of introducing a separate adapter parameter, consider treating it analogously (e.g., a teacher_settings could include an adapter or fine-tune specific config). If that’s too abstract, at least rename adapter to something like finetune_adapter and document it as the analog of teacher settings but for fine-tune.\nIf prompt_model and task_model (as in MIPRO) are essentially playing roles of teacher vs student, clarify that or even rename them to teacher_model and student_model for consistency. Alternatively, provide a unified interface where Teleprompter base could accept something like teacher=... in init or compile that could be a model or program. Having multiple parameters (prompt_model, task_model, teacher) is confusing; consolidating where possible would help (e.g., maybe define that teacher can be either a full DSPy Program or a raw LM; if the latter, treat it as the model to generate prompts).\nEssentially, reduce the terminology: decide on either “teacher” or specific terms, and use them consistently. If the role is to generate new prompts, maybe call it generator_model everywhere instead of prompt_model in one place and implicitly using teacher in another. Consistency in naming would reduce user confusion.\n\nUnify Metric Handling: Make sure the role of metric and metric_threshold is consistently implemented and documented:\n\nIf metric_threshold is supported in some optimizers (BootstrapFewShot, RandomSearch, MIPRO), consider supporting it in others that might benefit (or explicitly excluding it). At least document it uniformly. It might be useful in COPRO too (maybe to decide if a prompt is “good enough”). If it’s an advanced feature, ensure all classes that use metrics either accept metric_threshold or none of them do. As it stands, a user might not realize BootstrapFewShot accepts a metric_threshold because it wasn’t in official docs, which is a documentation inconsistency.\nSimilarly, if max_errors is a common safeguard, consider exposing it in all relevant optimizers (for example, COPRO and MIPRO do handle errors but not via a parameter; they rely on global settings or internal logic). It might be good to allow the user to set max_errors in MIPRO too for consistency, or state clearly that it uses the global dspy.settings.max_errors. Unifying this across classes (all teleprompters either take a max_errors or none do and it’s purely global) would avoid confusion.\n\nAlign Default Values and Ranges: Review the default values for parameters that serve similar purposes and align them unless there’s a strong reason not to:\n\nFor example, the default max_labeled_demos in MIPROv2 is 4 whereas in BootstrapFewShot it’s 16. If 16 was found to be too high in practice, perhaps all classes should default to 4 for consistency (or vice versa if 16 is preferred for thoroughness). Choose one philosophy (fewer demos vs more) and apply it uniformly so users have a consistent expectation.\nLikewise, ensure that if an optimization class is essentially a generalization of another, its defaults should not dramatically conflict. MIPROv2 is like a superset of BootstrapFewShot + COPRO; one would expect that if you use MIPROv2 in a “minimal” way, it might by default behave somewhat like a BootstrapFewShot (just with added capabilities). That could mean defaulting max_labeled_demos=16 as in BootstrapFewShot for a fair comparison, or at least documenting why it’s different.\nAnother default to align: LabeledFewShot’s k=16 vs BootstrapFewShot’s max_labeled_demos=16 (those match), but if any divergence occurs in future, keep them in sync.\nIf possible, use the same default num_threads behavior – e.g., default None meaning use dspy.settings.num_threads. Document that consistently so users know None implies some global or single-thread. Right now, it’s implied but not always explicitly stated in each class docs.\n\nRefine and Simplify Interfaces of Complex Classes: For very complex optimizers like MIPROv2 (and to a lesser extent COPRO), consider grouping some of the less commonly changed hyperparameters into a config object or using **kwargs to pass through to internal methods. As it stands, the compile signature of MIPROv2 is extremely long, which can be intimidating. Some ideas:\n\nGroup the proposer-related booleans into one structure or prefix them clearly. For example, instead of five separate flags, one could have a single proposers=dict(program_aware=True, data_aware=True, tip_aware=True, fewshot_aware=True) or similar. This way the signature is shorter and it’s clear they belong together. Or provide a simpler toggle that sets a combination of them (e.g., a mode for proposers).\nThe minibatch, minibatch_size, minibatch_full_eval_steps could perhaps be combined or managed by the auto mode. If auto is heavy, maybe always use full eval (minibatch=False). Document or enforce such relationships to reduce what the user must consider. If not grouping, at least document in one place how they interact (some of which the code does via errors).\nAnother approach: provide preset configurations for MIPRO (like how auto does) but maybe even expose them at a higher level rather than lots of individual args. For instance, an auto=\"heavy\" sets many underlying defaults. Perhaps include in docs or interface something like MIPROv2.heavy() as an alternate constructor classmethod to preconfigure, etc. This doesn’t change parameters per se, but helps users not have to tweak each one. This is more of a usability suggestion beyond just parameter format.\n\nWhile these suggestions don’t unify across all classes (since simpler ones don’t need it), they do make the outlier interfaces easier to handle, which indirectly unifies the experience. A user switching from BootstrapFewShot to MIPROv2 wouldn’t want to worry about 10 new parameters if not needed; having reasonable defaults and grouping helps.\nConsistent Documentation and Naming: Ensure that the documentation (docstrings or user guides) for each optimizer class follows a consistent template:\n\nList out positional and keyword-only arguments explicitly, and use the same terminology for similar things (e.g., always call them “bootstrapped demos” vs sometimes “augmented demos” etc., to avoid confusion).\nIf a parameter is effectively doing the same thing across classes, use the same name. For example, if we decide teacher_settings is the term, then perhaps adapter in BootstrapFinetune could be encompassed by teacher_settings as well (it could have keys for adapter vs others) or be renamed to something like finetune_settings. Right now the names teacher_settings, train_kwargs, and adapter all refer to configuration of the “optimization process or model” beyond just metric and data. A unified naming (maybe a generic config dict or breaking them into clearer categories) would help. For instance:\n\nteacher_settings could be expanded to handle fine-tuning specifics (not ideal semantic fit), or\nuse train_kwargs for all cases of LM training/hyperparameters (so BootstrapFewShot might not need it, but FinetuneTeleprompter does, and maybe MIPRO could reuse train_kwargs for consistency instead of burying fine-tune params in compile).\n\nThe goal is that a user reading the docs doesn’t have to guess that “adapter” in one class serves a role analogous to “teacher_settings” in another. If they truly are different in nature, clarify that in docs or choose distinct naming that reflects purpose (e.g., lm_adapter vs teacher_lm_settings might clarify one is for fine-tuning method, one for prompting method).\n\nUnify Process Flow Where Possible: While not directly about parameters, making sure each Teleprompter clearly states its two main phases (if any) in a similar way could help unify understanding. For instance, all compile methods could follow a pattern in documentation: “Preprocess (e.g., prepare student/teacher), Optimize (via bootstrapping or search), Post-process (attach demos or fine-tune weights)”. If the interface and documentation emphasize these stages similarly, users can map parameters to each stage (e.g., max_rounds -&gt; relates to optimization loop, exclude_demos -&gt; relates to post-process). Right now, each class’s documentation is isolated; a unified narrative would make the parameter sets feel more coherent.\n\nBy implementing these recommendations, the teleprompter optimizers would have a more consistent interface. For example, a user could expect that every optimizer’s compile is called with student=... , trainset=... , teacher=... , valset=... (where relevant) without worrying about positional quirks, and that if they see a parameter like max_x_demos or num_threads, it means the same general concept across the board. It would reduce the learning curve when moving from one optimizer to another and lower the chance of misuse due to inconsistent conventions."
