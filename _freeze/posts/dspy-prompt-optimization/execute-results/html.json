This has lead to the, now, popular expression and practice of **prompt engineering**.^[Prompt Engineering is the process of designing, crafting, and refining input text (a \"prompt\") to guide a Generative AI model toward producing a desired, high-quality, and relevant output. It's a combination of instruction, context, examples, and questioning to control the AI's behavior. It's not about coding; it's about communicating effectively with an AI using natural language.] There are several components that you can tweak in a prompt to improve a models performance and there are several ways to arrive to an optimized prompt. In this tutorial, we will focus on those the are automatically optimizable.\n\n### The optimizable component of a prompt.\n\n\n and more recently **context engineering** which is more about providing all the context for the task to be plausibly solvable by the LLM^[this is conceivable optimizable but would be much harder, it's usually in the user's input hands]. In other words, as I see it, context engineering is about creating a prompt or an onboarding for an intelligent entity to perform a task successfully whereas prompt engineering is about taking that and hacking it so that it actually works for a particular Intelligent entity (example here^[If I want to onboard an employess to classify some document for me, I would prepare some sort of onboarding document, this could include examples on how to classify some instructions, maybe a list of internal tools to accelerate or verify the job and explanation on how to use them, that would be context engineering, I would right it once and it would serve as a document to specify my intent. Then, if I hire someone as a trainer, they may need to translate, transform, or optimize my intent to a particular Intelligent entity. For instance, we may have someone who is not familiar with our corporate linguo or someone who does not speak the language in which the document was written. In those moments the translation and adaption of the intent would be prompt engineering. It is entirely possible to train a large language model that only use slang, if that was the only AI you have access to, you would need to prompt engineer so that you ask in slang for best results. This has nothing to do with the content and everything with the 'affinities' of the llm.]).\n\n\n### hey\nContext engineering is the art and science of filling the context window with just the right information at each step of an agent’s trajectory\n\nThe discipline of engineering context for AI to have the necessary information to get the job done end to end.\n\nContext engineering is building dynamic systems to provide the right information and tools in the right format such that the LLM can plausibly accomplish the task\n\nthe art of providing all the context for the task to be plausibly solvable by the LLM.\n\n\nIntent Oriented Programming: the practice of defining a program intent, by specifying inputs, outputs, evals and examples.\nMost people associate DSPy with automatic prompt optimization and by the end of this tutorial you'll understand why.\n\nDSPy is a python library^[python library is a collection of functions and objects]\n\n::: {#bfe5dd4e .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfrom dspy import *\ntranslator = Predict(\"french -> english\")\ntranslator.set_lm(LM(\"gpt-4.1\"))\n#translator(french = \"Allo\")\nprint(\"hello\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nhello\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn DSPy, this is all you need to create a program that translates text from french to english with gpt-4.1 (but how can that be? how can gpt-4.1 or any other model do it's job with so few instructions?), and the crazy thing is that if I do `set_lm(\"<another model and provider>\")` it will also work 🤯.\n\n```python\ntranslator.set_lm(LM(\"gemini/gemini-2.5-flash-lite-preview-06-17\"))\ntranslator(french = \"J'aime les animaux\")\n```\n\n```python\nconfigure(lm = LM(\"gpt-4.1-nano\"))\n\ntrainingset = [\n    Example(french=\"Salut\", english=\"Hi\").with_inputs(),\n    Example(french=\"Je suis dans le champs\", english=\"I am wrong\").with_inputs(),\n    Example(french=\"L'IA semble utile\", english=\"AI seems useful\").with_inputs(),\n    Example(french=\"La fleur est rose\", english=\"The flower is pink\").with_inputs(),\n    Example(french=\"Il était une fois un chat\", english=\"Once upon a time, there was a cat.\").with_inputs(),\n    Example(french=\"Bonjour, comment ça va?\", english=\"Hello, how are you?\").with_inputs()\n    ]\n\ndef translation_judge(example, prediction, trace=None):\n    judge = Predict(\"input_french, groundtruth_english, prediction_english -> prediction_vs_groundtruth_similarity: int\")\n    judge.set_lm(LM(\"gpt-4.1-nano\"))\n    return judge(input_french = example.french, groundtruth_english = example.english, prediction_english = prediction.english).score\n\noptimizer = MIPROv2(metric = translation_judge, auto=\"light\")\ntranslator_opt = optimizer.compile(translator, trainset = trainingset, requires_permission_to_run = False)\n\ntranslator_opt(french = \"J'aime les animaux\")\n```\n\nsome text\n\n",
