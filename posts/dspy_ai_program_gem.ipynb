    "The other day it occurred to me that most people building AI products (chatbot-like experiences) were not building AI programs. I then wondered: 'what would they need to build for their program to be an *AI program*?' I think the answer is they need to have AI contributing to the control flow of the application. A nice way to illustrate that is to have an AI deciding where my prompt goes in a growing tree of conversations instead of having code and buttons decide that.\n",

    "In this blog we will build a complete and working branching chat application. My intuition is that this is an important piece missing to AI chat currently. I don't want to have to search for a conversation like if it was 2023 ;)\n",

    "To build an automatically branching chat we will need 4 pieces.\n",

    "1. We need a data structure that will hold the chat tree.\n",
    "2. We need a conversation router that will decide where the user's prompt gets connected in the tree.\n",

This includes empathy, justice, and the courage to repair harm. The more\\u003cbr\\u003eyou practice it, the more capacity for connection you\\u2014and those around\\u003cbr\\u003eyou\\u2014develop.  2. Learning \\u2013 an ever-widening curiosity about the world,\\u003cbr\\u003eyourself, and other people. It keeps your mind plastic, counters arrogance, and\\u003cbr\\u003eequips you to solve new problems.

Generosity \\u2013 sharing time,\\u003cbr\\u003eattention, resources, and opportunities without expecting a transactional\\u003cbr\\u003ereturn. Paradoxically, the more freely you give, the more social and emotional\\u003cbr\\u003ecapital you tend to accumulate, which in turn fuels deeper learning and stronger\\u003cbr\\u003erelationships.  Together these form a self-reinforcing loop: love motivates\\u003cbr\\u003elearning, learning sharpens generosity, generosity deepens love.
